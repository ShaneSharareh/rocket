            <p>Every Western institution was unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic, despite many prior warnings. This monumental failure of institutional effectiveness will reverberate for the rest of the decade, but it’s not too early to ask why, and what we need to do about it.</p>
            <p>Many of us would like to pin the cause on one political party or another, on one government or another. But the harsh reality is that it all failed — no Western country, or state, or city was prepared — and despite hard work and often extraordinary sacrifice by many people within these institutions. So the problem runs deeper than your favorite political opponent or your home nation.</p>
            <p>Part of the problem is clearly foresight, a failure of imagination. But the other part of the problem is what we didn’t *do* in advance, and what we’re failing to do now. And that is a failure of action, and specifically our widespread inability to *build*.</p>
            <p>We see this today with the things we urgently need but don’t have. We don’t have enough coronavirus tests, or test materials — including, amazingly, cotton swabs and common reagents. We don’t have enough ventilators, negative pressure rooms, and ICU beds. And we don’t have enough surgical masks, eye shields, and medical gowns — as I write this, New York City has put out a desperate call for rain ponchos to be used as medical gowns. Rain ponchos! In 2020! In America!</p>
            <p>We also don’t have therapies or a vaccine — despite, again, years of advance warning about bat-borne coronaviruses. Our scientists will hopefully invent therapies and a vaccine, but then we may not have the manufacturing factories required to scale their production. And even then, we’ll see if we can deploy therapies or a vaccine fast enough to matter — it took scientists 5 years to get regulatory testing approval for the new Ebola vaccine after that scourge’s 2014 outbreak, at the cost of many lives.</p>
            <p>In the U.S., we don’t even have the ability to get federal bailout money to the people and businesses that need it. Tens of millions of laid off workers and their families, and many millions of small businesses, are in serious trouble *right now*, and we have no direct method to transfer them money without potentially disastrous delays. A government that collects money from all its citizens and businesses each year has never built a system to distribute money to us when it’s needed most.</p>
            <p>Why do we not have these things? Medical equipment and financial conduits involve no rocket science whatsoever. At least therapies and vaccines are hard! Making masks and transferring money are not hard. We could have these things but we chose not to — specifically we chose not to have the mechanisms, the factories, the systems to make these things. We chose not to *build*.</p>
            <p>You don’t just see this smug complacency, this satisfaction with the status quo and the unwillingness to build, in the pandemic, or in healthcare generally. You see it throughout Western life, and specifically throughout American life.</p>
            <p>You see it in housing and the physical footprint of our cities. We can’t build nearly enough housing in our cities with surging economic potential — which results in crazily skyrocketing housing prices in places like San Francisco, making it nearly impossible for regular people to move in and take the jobs of the future. We also can’t build the cities themselves anymore. When the producers of HBO’s “Westworld” wanted to portray the American city of the future, they didn’t film in Seattle or Los Angeles or Austin — they went to Singapore. We should have gleaming skyscrapers and spectacular living environments in all our best cities at levels way beyond what we have now; where are they?</p>
            <p>You see it in education. We have top-end universities, yes, but with the capacity to teach only a microscopic percentage of the 4 million new 18 year olds in the U.S. each year, or the 120 million new 18 year olds in the world each year. Why not educate every 18 year old? Isn’t that the most important thing we can possibly do? Why not build a far larger number of universities, or scale the ones we have way up? The last major innovation in K-12 education was Montessori, which traces back to the 1960s; we’ve been doing education research that’s never reached practical deployment for 50 years since; why not build a lot more great K-12 schools using everything we now know? We know one-to-one tutoring can reliably increase education outcomes by two standard deviations (the Bloom two-sigma effect); we have the internet; why haven’t we built systems to match every young learner with an older tutor to dramatically improve student success?</p>
            <p>You see it in manufacturing. Contrary to conventional wisdom, American manufacturing output is higher than ever, but why has so much manufacturing been offshored to places with cheaper manual labor? We know how to build highly automated factories. We know the enormous number of higher paying jobs we would create to design and build and operate those factories. We know — and we’re experiencing right now! — the strategic problem of relying on offshore manufacturing of key goods. Why aren’t we building Elon Musk’s “alien dreadnoughts” — giant, gleaming, state of the art factories producing every conceivable kind of product, at the highest possible quality and lowest possible cost — all throughout our country?</p>
            <p>You see it in transportation. Where are the supersonic aircraft? Where are the millions of delivery drones? Where are the high speed trains, the soaring monorails, the hyperloops, and yes, the flying cars?</p>
            <p>Is the problem money? That seems hard to believe when we have the money to wage endless wars in the Middle East and repeatedly bail out incumbent banks, airlines, and carmakers. The federal government just passed a $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package in two weeks! Is the problem capitalism? I’m with Nicholas Stern when he says that capitalism is how we take care of people we don’t know — all of these fields are highly lucrative already and should be prime stomping grounds for capitalist investment, good both for the investor and the customers who are served. Is the problem technical competence? Clearly not, or we wouldn’t have the homes and skyscrapers, schools and hospitals, cars and trains, computers and smartphones, that we already have.</p>
            <p>The problem is desire. We need to *want* these things. The problem is inertia. We need to want these things more than we want to prevent these things. The problem is regulatory capture. We need to want new companies to build these things, even if incumbents don’t like it, even if only to force the incumbents to build these things. And the problem is will. We need to build these things.</p>
            <p>And we need to separate the imperative to build these things from ideology and politics. Both sides need to contribute to building.</p>
            <p>The right starts out in a more natural, albeit compromised, place. The right is generally pro production, but is too often corrupted by forces that hold back market-based competition and the building of things. The right must fight hard against crony capitalism, regulatory capture, ossified oligopolies, risk-inducing offshoring, and investor-friendly buybacks in lieu of customer-friendly (and, over a longer period of time, even more investor-friendly) innovation.</p>
            <p>It’s time for full-throated, unapologetic, uncompromised political support from the right for aggressive investment in new products, in new industries, in new factories, in new science, in big leaps forward.</p>
            <p>The left starts out with a stronger bias toward the public sector in many of these areas. To which I say, prove the superior model! Demonstrate that the public sector can build better hospitals, better schools, better transportation, better cities, better housing. Stop trying to protect the old, the entrenched, the irrelevant; commit the public sector fully to the future. Milton Friedman once said the great public sector mistake is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results. Instead of taking that as an insult, take it as a challenge — build new things and show the results!</p>
            <p>Show that new models of public sector healthcare can be inexpensive and effective — how about starting with the VA? When the next coronavirus comes along, blow us away! Even private universities like Harvard are lavished with public funding; why can’t 100,000 or 1 million students a year attend Harvard? Why shouldn’t regulators and taxpayers demand that Harvard build? Solve the climate crisis by building — energy experts say that all carbon-based electrical power generation on the planet could be replaced by a few thousand new zero-emission nuclear reactors, so let’s build those. Maybe we can start with 10 new reactors? Then 100? Then the rest?</p>
            <p>In fact, I think building is how we reboot the American dream. The things we build in huge quantities, like computers and TVs, drop rapidly in price. The things we don’t, like housing, schools, and hospitals, skyrocket in price. What’s the American dream? The opportunity to have a home of your own, and a family you can provide for. We need to break the rapidly escalating price curves for housing, education, and healthcare, to make sure that every American can realize the dream, and the only way to do that is to build.</p>
            <p>Building isn’t easy, or we’d already be doing all this. We need to demand more of our political leaders, of our CEOs, our entrepreneurs, our investors. We need to demand more of our culture, of our society. And we need to demand more from one another. We’re all necessary, and we can all contribute, to building.</p>
            <p>Every step of the way, to everyone around us, we should be asking the question, what are you building? What are you building directly, or helping other people to build, or teaching other people to build, or taking care of people who are building? If the work you’re doing isn’t either leading to something being built or taking care of people directly, we’ve failed you, and we need to get you into a position, an occupation, a career where you can contribute to building. There are always outstanding people in even the most broken systems — we need to get all the talent we can on the biggest problems we have, and on building the answers to those problems.</p>
            <p>I expect this essay to be the target of criticism. Here’s a modest proposal to my critics. Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own! What do you think we should build? There’s an excellent chance I’ll agree with you.</p>
            <p>Our nation and our civilization were built on production, on building. Our forefathers and foremothers built roads and trains, farms and factories, then the computer, the microchip, the smartphone, and uncounted thousands of other things that we now take for granted, that are all around us, that define our lives and provide for our well-being. There is only one way to honor their legacy and to create the future we want for our own children and grandchildren, and that’s to build.</p>

            <p>December 2019</p>
            <p>The most damaging thing you learned in school wasn't something you learned in any specific class. It was learning to get good grades.</p>
            <p>When I was in college, a particularly earnest philosophy grad student once told me that he never cared what grade he got in a class, only what he learned in it. This stuck in my mind because it was the only time I ever heard anyone say such a thing.</p>
            <p>For me, as for most students, the measurement of what I was learning completely dominated actual learning in college. I was fairly earnest; I was genuinely interested in most of the classes I took, and I worked hard. And yet I worked by far the hardest when I was studying for a test.</p>
            <p>In theory, tests are merely what their name implies: tests of what you've learned in the class. In theory you shouldn't have to prepare for a test in a class any more than you have to prepare for a blood test. In theory you learn from taking the class, from going to the lectures and doing the reading and/or assignments, and the test that comes afterward merely measures how well you learned.</p>
            <p>In practice, as almost everyone reading this will know, things are so different that hearing this explanation of how classes and tests are meant to work is like hearing the etymology of a word whose meaning has changed completely. In practice, the phrase \"studying for a test\" was almost redundant, because that was when one really studied. The difference between diligent and slack students was that the former studied hard for tests and the latter didn't. No one was pulling all-nighters two weeks into the semester.</p>
            <p>Even though I was a diligent student, almost all the work I did in school was aimed at getting a good grade on something.</p>
            <p>To many people, it would seem strange that the preceding sentence has a \"though\" in it. Aren't I merely stating a tautology? Isn't that what a diligent student is, a straight-A student? That's how deeply the conflation of learning with grades has infused our culture.</p>
            <p>Is it so bad if learning is conflated with grades? Yes, it is bad. And it wasn't till decades after college, when I was running Y Combinator, that I realized how bad it is.</p>
            <p>I knew of course when I was a student that studying for a test is far from identical with actual learning. At the very least, you don't retain knowledge you cram into your head the night before an exam. But the problem is worse than that. The real problem is that most tests don't come close to measuring what they're supposed to.</p>
            <p>If tests truly were tests of learning, things wouldn't be so bad. Getting good grades and learning would converge, just a little late. The problem is that nearly all tests given to students are terribly hackable. Most people who've gotten good grades know this, and know it so well they've ceased even to question it. You'll see when you realize how naive it sounds to act otherwise.</p>
            <p>Suppose you're taking a class on medieval history and the final exam is coming up. The final exam is supposed to be a test of your knowledge of medieval history, right? So if you have a couple days between now and the exam, surely the best way to spend the time, if you want to do well on the exam, is to read the best books you can find about medieval history. Then you'll know a lot about it, and do well on the exam.</p>
            <p>No, no, no, experienced students are saying to themselves. If you merely read good books on medieval history, most of the stuff you learned wouldn't be on the test. It's not good books you want to read, but the lecture notes and assigned reading in this class. And even most of that you can ignore, because you only have to worry about the sort of thing that could turn up as a test question. You're looking for sharply-defined chunks of information. If one of the assigned readings has an interesting digression on some subtle point, you can safely ignore that, because it's not the sort of thing that could be turned into a test question. But if the professor tells you that there were three underlying causes of the Schism of 1378, or three main consequences of the Black Death, you'd better know them. And whether they were in fact the causes or consequences is beside the point. For the purposes of this class they are.</p>
            <p>At a university there are often copies of old exams floating around, and these narrow still further what you have to learn. As well as learning what kind of questions this professor asks, you'll often get actual exam questions. Many professors re-use them. After teaching a class for 10 years, it would be hard not to, at least inadvertently.</p>
            <p>In some classes, your professor will have had some sort of political axe to grind, and if so you'll have to grind it too. The need for this varies. In classes in math or the hard sciences or engineering it's rarely necessary, but at the other end of the spectrum there are classes where you couldn't get a good grade without it.</p>
            <p>Getting a good grade in a class on x is so different from learning a lot about x that you have to choose one or the other, and you can't blame students if they choose grades. Everyone judges them by their grades graduate programs, employers, scholarships, even their own parents.</p>
            <p>I liked learning, and I really enjoyed some of the papers and programs I wrote in college. But did I ever, after turning in a paper in some class, sit down and write another just for fun? Of course not. I had things due in other classes. If it ever came to a choice of learning or grades, I chose grades. I hadn't come to college to do badly.</p>
            <p>Anyone who cares about getting good grades has to play this game, or they'll be surpassed by those who do. And at elite universities, that means nearly everyone, since someone who didn't care about getting good grades probably wouldn't be there in the first place. The result is that students compete to maximize the difference between learning and getting good grades.</p>
            <p>Why are tests so bad? More precisely, why are they so hackable? Any experienced programmer could answer that. How hackable is software whose author hasn't paid any attention to preventing it from being hacked? Usually it's as porous as a colander.</p>
            <p>Hackable is the default for any test imposed by an authority. The reason the tests you're given are so consistently bad so consistently far from measuring what they're supposed to measure is simply that the people creating them haven't made much effort to prevent them from being hacked.</p>
            <p>But you can't blame teachers if their tests are hackable. Their job is to teach, not to create unhackable tests. The real problem is grades, or more precisely, that grades have been overloaded. If grades were merely a way for teachers to tell students what they were doing right and wrong, like a coach giving advice to an athlete, students wouldn't be tempted to hack tests. But unfortunately after a certain age grades become more than advice. After a certain age, whenever you're being taught, you're usually also being judged.</p>
            <p>I've used college tests as an example, but those are actually the least hackable. All the tests most students take their whole lives are at least as bad, including, most spectacularly of all, the test that gets them into college. If getting into college were merely a matter of having the quality of one's mind measured by admissions officers the way scientists measure the mass of an object, we could tell teenage kids \"learn a lot\" and leave it at that. You can tell how bad college admissions are, as a test, from how unlike high school that sounds. In practice, the freakishly specific nature of the stuff ambitious kids have to do in high school is directly proportionate to the hackability of college admissions. The classes you don't care about that are mostly memorization, the random \"extracurricular activities\" you have to participate in to show you're \"well-rounded,\" the standardized tests as artificial as chess, the \"essay\" you have to write that's presumably meant to hit some very specific target, but you're not told what.</p>
            <p>As well as being bad in what it does to kids, this test is also bad in the sense of being very hackable. So hackable that whole industries have grown up to hack it. This is the explicit purpose of test-prep companies and admissions counsellors, but it's also a significant part of the function of private schools.</p>
            <p>Why is this particular test so hackable? I think because of what it's measuring. Although the popular story is that the way to get into a good college is to be really smart, admissions officers at elite colleges neither are, nor claim to be, looking only for that. What are they looking for? They're looking for people who are not simply smart, but admirable in some more general sense. And how is this more general admirableness measured? The admissions officers feel it. In other words, they accept who they like.</p>
            <p>So what college admissions is a test of is whether you suit the taste of some group of people. Well, of course a test like that is going to be hackable. And because it's both very hackable and there's (thought to be) a lot at stake, it's hacked like nothing else. That's why it distorts your life so much for so long.</p>
            <p>It's no wonder high school students often feel alienated. The shape of their lives is completely artificial.</p>
            <p>But wasting your time is not the worst thing the educational system does to you. The worst thing it does is to train you that the way to win is by hacking bad tests. This is a much subtler problem that I didn't recognize until I saw it happening to other people.</p>
            <p>When I started advising startup founders at Y Combinator, especially young ones, I was puzzled by the way they always seemed to make things overcomplicated. How, they would ask, do you raise money? What's the trick for making venture capitalists want to invest in you? The best way to make VCs want to invest in you, I would explain, is to actually be a good investment. Even if you could trick VCs into investing in a bad startup, you'd be tricking yourselves too. You're investing time in the same company you're asking them to invest money in. If it's not a good investment, why are you even doing it?</p>
            <p>Oh, they'd say, and then after a pause to digest this revelation, they'd ask: What makes a startup a good investment?</p>
            <p>So I would explain that what makes a startup promising, not just in the eyes of investors but in fact, is <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/growth.html\"><u>growth</u></a>. Ideally in revenue, but failing that in usage. What they needed to do was get lots of users.</p>
            <p>How does one get lots of users? They had all kinds of ideas about that. They needed to do a big launch that would get them \"exposure.\" They needed influential people to talk about them. They even knew they needed to launch on a tuesday, because that's when one gets the most attention.</p>
            <p>No, I would explain, that is not how to get lots of users. The way you get lots of users is to make the product really great. Then people will not only use it but recommend it to their friends, so your growth will be exponential once you <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/ds.html\"><u>get it started</u></a>.</p>
            <p>At this point I've told the founders something you'd think would be completely obvious: that they should make a good company by making a good product. And yet their reaction would be something like the reaction many physicists must have had when they first heard about the theory of relativity: a mixture of astonishment at its apparent genius, combined with a suspicion that anything so weird couldn't possibly be right. Ok, they would say, dutifully. And could you introduce us to such-and-such influential person? And remember, we want to launch on Tuesday.</p>
            <p>It would sometimes take founders years to grasp these simple lessons. And not because they were lazy or stupid. They just seemed blind to what was right in front of them.</p>
            <p>Why, I would ask myself, do they always make things so complicated? And then one day I realized this was not a rhetorical question.</p>
            <p>Why did founders tie themselves in knots doing the wrong things when the answer was right in front of them? Because that was what they'd been trained to do. Their education had taught them that the way to win was to hack the test. And without even telling them they were being trained to do this. The younger ones, the recent graduates, had never faced a non-artificial test. They thought this was just how the world worked: that the first thing you did, when facing any kind of challenge, was to figure out what the trick was for hacking the test. That's why the conversation would always start with how to raise money, because that read as the test. It came at the end of YC. It had numbers attached to it, and higher numbers seemed to be better. It must be the test.</p>
            <p>There are certainly big chunks of the world where the way to win is to hack the test. This phenomenon isn't limited to schools. And some people, either due to ideology or ignorance, claim that this is true of startups too. But it isn't. In fact, one of the most striking things about startups is the degree to which you win by simply doing good work. There are edge cases, as there are in anything, but in general you win by getting users, and what users care about is whether the product does what they want.</p>
            <p>Why did it take me so long to understand why founders made startups overcomplicated? Because I hadn't realized explicitly that schools train us to win by hacking bad tests. And not just them, but me! I'd been trained to hack bad tests too, and hadn't realized it till decades later.</p>
            <p>I had lived as if I realized it, but without knowing why. For example, I had avoided working for big companies. But if you'd asked why, I'd have said it was because they were bogus, or bureaucratic. Or just yuck. I never understood how much of my dislike of big companies was due to the fact that you win by hacking bad tests.</p>
            <p>Similarly, the fact that the tests were unhackable was a lot of what attracted me to startups. But again, I hadn't realized that explicitly.</p>
            <p>I had in effect achieved by successive approximations something that may have a closed-form solution. I had gradually undone my training in hacking bad tests without knowing I was doing it. Could someone coming out of school banish this demon just by knowing its name, and saying begone? It seems worth trying.</p>
            <p>Merely talking explicitly about this phenomenon is likely to make things better, because much of its power comes from the fact that we take it for granted. After you've noticed it, it seems the elephant in the room, but it's a pretty well camouflaged elephant. The phenomenon is so old, and so pervasive. And it's simply the result of neglect. No one meant things to be this way. This is just what happens when you combine learning with grades, competition, and the naive assumption of unhackability.</p>
            <p>It was mind-blowing to realize that two of the things I'd puzzled about the most the bogusness of high school, and the difficulty of getting founders to see the obvious both had the same cause. It's rare for such a big block to slide into place so late.</p>
            <p>Usually when that happens it has implications in a lot of different areas, and this case seems no exception. For example, it suggests both that education could be done better, and how you might fix it. But it also suggests a potential answer to the question all big companies seem to have: how can we be more like a startup? I'm not going to chase down all the implications now. What I want to focus on here is what it means for individuals.</p>
            <p>To start with, it means that most ambitious kids graduating from college have something they may want to unlearn. But it also changes how you look at the world. Instead of looking at all the different kinds of work people do and thinking of them vaguely as more or less appealing, you can now ask a very specific question that will sort them in an interesting way: to what extent do you win at this kind of work by hacking bad tests?</p>
            <p>It would help if there was a way to recognize bad tests quickly. Is there a pattern here? It turns out there is.</p>
            <p>Tests can be divided into two kinds: those that are imposed by authorities, and those that aren't. Tests that aren't imposed by authorities are inherently unhackable, in the sense that no one is claiming they're tests of anything more than they actually test. A football match, for example, is simply a test of who wins, not which team is better. You can tell that from the fact that commentators sometimes say afterward that the better team won. Whereas tests imposed by authorities are usually proxies for something else. A test in a class is supposed to measure not just how well you did on that particular test, but how much you learned in the class. While tests that aren't imposed by authorities are inherently unhackable, those imposed by authorities have to be made unhackable. Usually they aren't. So as a first approximation, bad tests are roughly equivalent to tests imposed by authorities.</p>
            <p>You might actually like to win by hacking bad tests. Presumably some people do. But I bet most people who find themselves doing this kind of work don't like it. They just take it for granted that this is how the world works, unless you want to drop out and be some kind of hippie artisan.</p>
            <p>I suspect many people implicitly assume that working in a field with bad tests is the price of making lots of money. But that, I can tell you, is false. It used to be true. In the mid-twentieth century, when the economy was <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/re.html\"><u>composed of oligopolies</u></a>, the only way to the top was by playing their game. But it's not true now. There are now ways to get rich by doing good work, and that's part of the reason people are so much more excited about getting rich than they used to be. When I was a kid, you could either become an engineer and make cool things, or make lots of money by becoming an \"executive.\" Now you can make lots of money by making cool things.</p>
            <p>Hacking bad tests is becoming less important as the link between work and authority erodes. The erosion of that link is one of the most important trends happening now, and we see its effects in almost every kind of work people do. Startups are one of the most visible examples, but we see much the same thing in writing. Writers no longer have to submit to publishers and editors to reach readers; now they can go direct.</p>
            <p>The more I think about this question, the more optimistic I get. This seems one of those situations where we don't realize how much something was holding us back until it's eliminated. And I can foresee the whole bogus edifice crumbling. Imagine what happens as more and more people start to ask themselves if they want to win by hacking bad tests, and decide that they don't. The kinds of work where you win by hacking bad tests will be starved of talent, and the kinds where you win by doing good work will see an influx of the most ambitious people. And as hacking bad tests shrinks in importance, education will evolve to stop training us to do it. Imagine what the world could look like if that happened.</p>
            <p>This is not just a lesson for individuals to unlearn, but one for society to unlearn, and we'll be amazed at the energy that's liberated when we do.</p>
            <p></p>

            <p></p>
            <p>Notes</p>
            <p>[1] If using tests only to measure learning sounds impossibly utopian, that is already the way things work at Lambda School. Lambda School doesn't have grades. You either graduate or you don't. The only purpose of tests is to decide at each stage of the curriculum whether you can continue to the next. So in effect the whole school is pass/fail.</p>
            <p>[2] If the final exam consisted of a long conversation with the professor, you could prepare for it by reading good books on medieval history. A lot of the hackability of tests in schools is due to the fact that the same test has to be given to large numbers of students.</p>
            <p>[3] Learning is the naive algorithm for getting good grades.</p>
            <p>[4] <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/gba.html\"><u>Hacking</u></a> has multiple senses. There's a narrow sense in which it means to compromise something. That's the sense in which one hacks a bad test. But there's another, more general sense, meaning to find a surprising solution to a problem, often by thinking differently about it. Hacking in this sense is a wonderful thing. And indeed, some of the hacks people use on bad tests are impressively ingenious; the problem is not so much the hacking as that, because the tests are hackable, they don't test what they're meant to.</p>
            <p>[5] The people who pick startups at Y Combinator are similar to admissions officers, except that instead of being arbitrary, their acceptance criteria are trained by a very tight feedback loop. If you accept a bad startup or reject a good one, you will usually know it within a year or two at the latest, and often within a month.</p>
            <p>[6] I'm sure admissions officers are tired of reading applications from kids who seem to have no personality beyond being willing to seem however they're supposed to seem to get accepted. What they don't realize is that they are, in a sense, looking in a mirror. The lack of authenticity in the applicants is a reflection of the arbitrariness of the application process. A dictator might just as well complain about the lack of authenticity in the people around him.</p>
            <p>[7] By good work, I don't mean morally good, but good in the sense in which a good craftsman does good work.</p>
            <p>[8] There are borderline cases where it's hard to say which category a test falls in. For example, is raising venture capital like college admissions, or is it like selling to a customer?</p>
            <p>[9] Note that a good test is merely one that's unhackable. Good here doesn't mean morally good, but good in the sense of working well. The difference between fields with bad tests and good ones is not that the former are bad and the latter are good, but that the former are bogus and the latter aren't. But those two measures are not unrelated. As Tara Ploughman said, the path from good to evil goes through bogus.</p>
            <p>[10] People who think the recent increase in <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/ineq.html\"><u>economic inequality</u></a> is due to changes in tax policy seem very naive to anyone with experience in startups. Different people are getting rich now than used to, and they're getting much richer than mere tax savings could make them.</p>
            <p>[11] Note to tiger parents: you may think you're training your kids to win, but if you're training them to win by hacking bad tests, you are, as parents so often do, training them to fight the last war.</p>

            <p>Charlie Munger gave a <a rel=\"noopener\"
            href=\"https://fs.blog/2013/02/the-psychology-of-human-misjudgement/\">speech</a> to Harvard University in
            1995. It was about how he built his own curriculum for Psychology. He’s an ace investor - dealing with
            psychology everyday to make money in the market. However, this curriculum is not just about investing
            psychology. It’s about everything.</p>
            <h1>Key takeaway</h1>
            <p>There are 25 tendencies that humans display. These are useful for running ourselves in automatic mode. However,
            sometimes, they trip us up. It pays to know when one of your tendencies is acting against you - and when it’s
            acting for you.</p>
            <p>Keep your mind in order, and it will serve you well.</p>
            <p>Munger began with the theory of evolution.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>I was aware that man was a “social animal,” greatly and automatically influenced by behavior he observed in
            men around him. I also knew that man lived, like barnyard animals and monkeys, in limited size dominance
            hierarchies, wherein he tended to respect authority and to like and cooperate with his own hierarchy members
            while displaying considerable distrust and dislike for competing men not in his own hierarchy.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>However, this template wasn’t enough to explain the extreme irrationality surrounding him. Thus began his quest
            to cope with irrationality better. The search for his models to explain human behaviour gave birth to this essay
            - The Psychology of Human Misjudgment.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>“I saw this patterned irrationality, which was so extreme, and I had no theory to deal with it. So I created
            my own system of psychology.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Here are the tendencies.</p>
            <h1>Reward and Punishment super-response tendency</h1>
            <p>Incentives drive people. People work towards rewards, and away from punishments.</p>
            <p>FedEx faced a peculiar problem. They wanted to deliver packages on time. For this, they needed to load their
            airplanes before sunrise. The catch - they were never on time. The night shift workers were paid by the hour,
            and expected to work the entire 8 hour night shift. The idea was, if they spend enough time on the shift,
            they’ll get the job done. (As some managers still think - in places with fixed work hours)</p>
            <p>Finally, somebody got the idea that it was foolish to pay the night shift by the hour. The employer wanted rapid
            loading of a plane, not maximized billable hours of employee service. Maybe if they paid the employees per shift
            and let all night shift employees go home when all the planes were loaded, the system would work better. And, lo
            and behold, that solution worked.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>“If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason.” - Ben Franklin</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Incentives are one of the better understood parts of Psychology. However, that doesn’t mean incentives explains
            everything. Focusing just on this because you understand it better can lead to ruin. This is <a rel=\"noopener\"
            href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument\">the man with a hammer tendency</a> - To a man
            with just a hammer, everything looks like a nail.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Skinner [a famed psychologist] lost most of his personal reputation (a) by overclaiming for incentive
            superpower to the point of thinking he could create a human utopia with it and (b) by displaying hardly any
            recognition of the power of the rest of psychology.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h4>Incentive caused bias</h4>
            <p>Since incentives are so powerful, they end up biasing you and everyone around you.</p>
            <p>This means, you should distrust the advice of your professional advisor - specially when it’s good for the
            advisor. The general antidotes here are:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>(1) fear professional advice when it is good for the advisor; <br>
            (2) learn and use the basic elements of your advisor’s trade as you deal with your advisor; <br>
            (3) double check, disbelieve, or replace much of what you’re told, to the degree that seems appropriate
            after objective thought.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The ubiquity of incentive-caused
            bias has vast consequences. For instance, a sales force living only on commissions will be much harder to keep
            moral than one under less pressure to earn their living.</p>
            <p>Things work the same way with punishments, although not as well as rewards.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Around the time of Caesar, there was a European tribe that, when the assembly horn blew, always killed the
            last warrior to reach his assigned place, and no one enjoyed fighting this tribe.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h1>Liking / Loving tendency</h1>
            <p>We tend to see people we like in a better light than they are.</p>
            <p>One consequence of Liking/ Loving Tendency is that it acts as a conditioning device that makes the liker or lover
            tend to -</p>
            <p>(1) ignore faults of and comply with wishes of, the object of his affection <br>
            (2) favor people, products, and actions merely associated with the object
            of his affection (<a
            href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/Psychology-of-Human-Misjudgment.html#influence-from-mere-association-tendency\">Influence
            from mere association tendency</a>) <br>
            (3) distort other facts to facilitate love.</p>
            <p>The phenomenon of liking and loving causing admiration also works in reverse. Admiration
            also causes or intensifies liking or love. With this “feedback mode” in place, the consequences are often
            extreme, sometimes even causing deliberate self-destruction to help what is loved.</p>
            <h1>Disliking / Hating tendency</h1>
            <p>We tend to see people we dislike in a worse light than they are.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Distortion of that kind is often so extreme that miscognition is shockingly large. When the World Trade
            Center was destroyed, many Pakistanis immediately concluded that the Hindus did it, while many Muslims
            concluded that the Jews did it. Such factual distortions often make mediation between opponents locked in
            hatred either difficult or impossible.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h1>Doubt Avoidance tendency</h1>
            <p>The brain of man is programmed to quickly remove doubt by reaching some decision.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>After all, the one thing that is surely counterproductive for a prey animal that is threatened by a predator
            is to take a long time in deciding what to do</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h1>Inconsistency Avoidance Tendency</h1>
            <p>Humans like to be consistent in everything they do, everything they say, and everything they are.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Practically everyone has a great many bad habits he has long maintained despite their being known as bad</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            <p>“An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” -Ben Franklin</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Ben Franklin is indicating that Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency makes it much easier to prevent a habit than to
            change it.</p>
            <p>A quickly reached conclusion, triggered by Doubt-Avoidance Tendency, when combined with a tendency to resist any
            change in that conclusion, will cause a lot of errors in cognition for modern man.</p>
            <p>This tendency, along with doubt avoidance work together against <a
            href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/A-framework-for-First-Principles-Thinking.html\">First Principles thinking.</a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>“It was not the intrinsic difficulty of new ideas that prevented their acceptance. Instead, the new ideas
            were not accepted because they were inconsistent with old ideas in place” - Lord Keynes</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The antidote comes from Charles Darwin. He trained himself to intensively consider any evidence tending to
            disconfirm any hypothesis
            of his, more so if he thought his hypothesis was a particularly good one.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>“At his peak, Einstein was a great destroyer of his own ideas.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>As a result, it is important not to put one’s brain in chains before one has come anywhere near his full
            potential as a rational person.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>“It’s very important to not put your brain in chains too young by what you shout out.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h1>Curiosity Tendency</h1>
            <p>Humans are curious. Those who can get into a culture which enhances curiosity will have several benefits.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Curiosity, enhanced by the best of modern education, helps man to prevent or reduce bad consequences arising
            from other psychological tendencies. The curious are also provided with much fun and wisdom long after
            formal education has ended.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h1>Kantian Fairness Tendency</h1>
            <p>Kant was famous for his <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative\">categorical
            imperative</a>, a “golden rule” that required humans to follow behavior patterns that, if followed by all
            others, would make the surrounding human system work best for everybody.</p>
            <p>It’s like the “treat others like you wish to be treated” idiom.</p>
            <p>Most humans expect fairness and are fair in situations they expect fairness. This shows up in queueing up for
            something, first come first serve and letting lane switchers on a merging highway cut in front of you.</p>
            <h1>Envy and Jealousy Tendency</h1>
            <blockquote>
            <p>“A member of a species designed through evolutionary process to want often-scarce food is going to be driven
            strongly toward getting food when it first sees food. And this is going to occur often and tend to create
            some conflict when the food is seen in the possession of another member of the same
            species”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h1>Reciprocation Tendency</h1>
            <p>The automatic tendency of humans to reciprocate both favors and disfavors is extreme, as it is in apes, monkeys,
            dogs, and many less cognitively gifted animals. The tendency facilitates group cooperation for the benefit of
            members.</p>
            <p>The standard antidote to one’s overactive hostility is to train oneself to defer reaction.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>“You can always tell the man off tomorrow if it is such a good idea.” - Tom Murphy</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Reciprocate-favor tendency operates at a subconscious level.</p>
            <p>When an automobile salesman graciously steers you into a comfortable place to sit and gives you a cup of coffee,
            you are very likely being tricked, by this small courtesy alone, into parting with an extra five hundred
            dollars.</p>
            <p>But here this might be balanced by your loss - the 500$ out of your pocket.</p>
            <p>But, if you’re a representative for a rich employer - you have no such downside. Now the minor favor you receive
            from the salesman
            is less opposed by the threat of extra cost to you because someone else is paying the extra cost. Under such
            circumstances, the salesman is often able to maximize his advantage, particularly when the government is the
            purchaser.</p>
            <p>The simplest antidote works best: Don’t let employees accept any favors from vendors.
            </p>
            <h1>Influence from Mere Association Tendency</h1>
            <p>A man buys a can of branded shoe polish, has a good experience with it when shining his shoes, and because of
            this “reward,” buys the same shoe polish when he needs another can.</p>
            <p>Advertisers know about the power of mere association. You won’t see Coke advertised alongside some account of the
            death of a child. Instead. Coke ads picture life as happier than reality.</p>
            <p>Some of the most important miscalculations come from what is accidentally associated with one’s past success, or
            one’s liking and loving, or one’s disliking and hating, which includes a natural hatred for bad news.</p>
            <p>Think of the following situations as antidotes -</p>
            <p>(1) Napoleon and Hitler when they invaded Russia after using their armies with much success elsewhere.</p>
            <p>(2) A man foolishly gambles in a casino and yet wins. This unlikely correlation causes him to try the casino
            again, or again and again, to his horrid detriment.</p>
            <p>The proper antidotes to being made such a patsy by past success are</p>
            <ul>
            <li>to carefully examine each past success, looking for accidental, non-causative factors associated with such
            success that will mislead</li>
            <li>to look for dangerous aspects of the new undertaking that were not present when past success occurred. <br>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Hating and disliking also cause miscalculation triggered by mere association. In business, I commonly see
            people underappraise both the competency and morals of competitors they dislike. This is a dangerous
            practice, usually disguised because it occurs on a subconscious basis.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency often has a shocking effect that helps swamp
            the normal tendency to return favor for favor.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, when one receives a favor, his condition is unpleasant, due to poverty, sickness, subjugation, or
            something else. In this case, the favor may trigger an envy-driven dislike for the person who was in so
            favorable a state that he could easily be a favor giver.</p>
            <p>Influence from mere association shows up in judging people via stereotypes as well.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Just as one must learn that trend does not always correctly predict destiny, one must learn that the average
            dimension in some group will not reliably guide him to the dimension of some specific item. Otherwise one
            will make many errors, like that of the fellow who drowned in a river that averaged out only eighteen inches
            deep.</p>
            </blockquote>

            meaningless.</a></p>
            <h1>Pain Avoiding Psychological Denial</h1>
            <p>The reality is too painful to bear, so one distorts the facts until they become bearable. The tendency’s most
            extreme outcomes are usually mixed up with love, death, and chemical dependency.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>“It is not necessary to hope in order to persevere.” &shy;- William the Silent</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h1>Excessive Self Regard Tendency</h1>
            <p>Humans think of themselves as better than they are, think of their possessions as more valuable than they are,
            and think of their decisions as better than they are.</p>
            <p>There is a name in psychology for this overappraise-your-own-possessions phenomenon: the “<a rel=\"noopener\"
            href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect\">endowment effect</a>”. And all man’s decisions are
            suddenly regarded by him as better than would have been the case just before he made them.</p>
            <p>Mans excessive self regard tendency also makes him prefer people like him.</p>

            <p>The quantity of man’s pleasure from a ten dollar gain does not match the quantity of his displeasure from a

            <p>In displaying Deprival-Superreaction Tendency, man incurs disadvantage by misframing his problems. He will often
            compare what is near instead of what really matters. For instance, a man with $10 million in his brokerage

            <h1>Social-Proof Tendency</h1>
            <p>Mans evolution left him with Social-Proof Tendency, an automatic tendency to think and act as he sees others

            What simpler way could there be to find out how to walk to a big football game in a strange city than by

            <p>Because both bad and good behavior are made contagious by Social-Proof Tendency, it is important that human

            <p>(1) stop any bad behavior before it spreads <br>
            (2) foster and display all good behavior.</p>
            <p>In social proof, it is not only action by others that misleads but also their inaction. In the presence of doubt,
            inaction by others becomes social proof that inaction is the right course.</p>

            <p>Mans imperfect, limited-capacity brain drifts into working with what’s easily available to it. And the brain
            can’t use what it can’t remember or what it is blocked from recognizing because it is heavily influenced by one
            or more psychological tendencies. And so the mind overweighs what is easily available.</p>
            <p>This tendency also shows up when thinking about difficult problems. Instead of measuring the factors that
            actually represent the problem, man tends to focus on measuring the factors that are easily available. These
            factors are usually numeric in nature. For example, solving for growth of a country via measuring only GDP.</p>
            <p>A simple, incomplete explanation to a complex phenomena gains widespread attention because it’s simple, easily

            <p>“Sessions” are the idea that your user’s state is somehow preserved when he/she clicks from one page to the next. Remember, HTTP is stateless, so it’s up to either the browser or your application to “remember” what needs to be remembered.</p>
            <p>In this lesson you’ll learn about sessions, browser cookies, and how authentication is built in Rails. We’ll cover both home-grown authentication and the most commonly used authentication gem, Devise.</p>

            </ul><h3 id=\"cookies-sessions-and-flashes\">Cookies, Sessions, and Flashes</h3>
            <p>Cookies, Sessions and Flashes are three special objects that Rails gives you which each behave a lot like hashes. They are used to persist data between requests, whether until just the next request, until the browser is closed, or until a specified expiration has been reached. In addition to different temporal concerns, they each solve slightly different use cases, covered below.</p>
            <h3 id=\"cookies\">Cookies</h3>
            <p>Cookies are key-value data pairs that are stored in the user’s browser until they reach their specified expiration date. They can be used for pretty much anything, most commonly to “bookmark” the user’s place in a web page if she gets disconnected or to store simple site display preferences. You could also store shopping cart information or even passwords but that would be a bad idea – you shouldn’t store anything in regular browser cookies that needs to either be secure or persisted across browser sessions. It’s too easy for users to clear their cache and/or steal/manipulate unsecured cookies.</p>
            <p>To work with cookies, Rails gives you access to a special hash called <code>cookies</code>, where each key-value pair is stored as a separate cookie on the user’s browser. If you were to save <code>cookies[:hair-color] = \"blonde\"</code>, you’d be able to pull up your browser’s developer tools and see a cookie on the user’s browser that has a key of <code>hair-color</code> and a value of <code>blonde</code>. Delete it using <code>cookies.delete(:hair-color)</code>.</p>
            <p>With each new request to your server, the browser will send along all the cookies and you can access them in your controllers and views like a normal hash. You can also set their expiration dates, for example using syntax like <code>cookies[:name] = { value: \"cookies YUM\", expires: Time.now + 3600}</code>.</p>
            <h3 id=\"sessions\">Sessions</h3>
            <p>Think about how websites keep track of how a user is logged in when the page reloads. HTTP requests are stateless so how can you tell that a given request actually came from that particular user who is logged in? This is why cookies are important – they allow you to keep track of your user from one request to another until the cookie expires.</p>
            <p>A special case is when you want to keep track of data in the user’s “session”, which represents all the stuff your user does while you’ve chosen to “remember” her, typically until the browser window is closed. In that case, every page she visits until the browser is closed will be part of the same session.</p>
            <p>To identify a user’s session information, Rails stores a special secure and tamper-proof cookie on the user’s browser that contains their entire session hash (look for it in your developer tools, usually under the “Resources” section) and it expires when the browser is closed. Whenever the user makes a request to your application, that request will also automatically include that session cookie (along with the other cookies) and you can use it to keep track of her logged-in state. This may all seem abstract now, but you’ll get a chance to see it in action shortly.</p>
            <p>Rails gives you access to the <code>session</code> hash in an almost identical way to the above-mentioned <code>cookies</code> hash. Use the <code>session</code> variable in your views or controllers like so:</p>
            <pre><code class=\"language-ruby\">  # app/controllers/users_controller.rb
            ...
            # Set a session value
            session[:current_user_id] = user.id

            # Access a session value
            some_other_variable_value = session[:other_variable_key]

            # Reset a session key
            session[:key_to_be_reset] = nil

            # Reset the entire session
            reset_session
            ...
            </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Why would you need both cookies and sessions? They are similar but not the same. <code>session</code> is an entire hash that gets put in the secure session cookie that expires when the user closes the browser. If you look in your developer tools, the “expiration” of that cookie is “session”. Each value in the <code>cookies</code> hash gets stored as an individual cookie.</p>
            <p>So cookies and sessions are sort of like temporary free database tables for you to use that are unique to a given user and will last until you either manually delete them, they have reached their expiration date, or the session is ended (depending on what you specified).</p>
            <h4 id=\"a-few-additional-notes-on-sessions-and-cookies\">A Few Additional Notes on Sessions and Cookies**</h4>
            <ul><li><code>session</code> and <code>cookies</code> aren’t really hashes, Rails just pretends they are so it’s easy for you to work with them. You can still consider them as hashes just because they act very similarly to hashes.</li>
            <li>You are size-limited in terms of how much you can store inside a session hash or browser cookie (~4kb). It is sufficient for any “normal” usage, but don’t go pretending either of these are actually substitutes for a database.</li>
            </ul><h3 id=\"flashes\">Flashes</h3>
            <p>You’ve already seen and used the <code>flash</code> hash by now, but we’ll cover it again from the perspective of understanding sessions. <code>flash</code> is a special hash (okay, a method that acts like a hash) that persists only from one request to the next. You can think of it as a <code>session</code> hash that self destructs after it’s opened. It’s commonly used to send messages from the controller to the view so the user can see success and failure messages after submitting forms.</p>
            <p>If you want to pop up “Thanks for signing up!” on the user’s browser after running the <code>#create</code> action (which usually uses <code>redirect_to</code> to send the user to a totally new page when successful), how do you send that success message? You can’t use an instance variable because the redirect caused the browser to issue a brand new HTTP request and so all instance variables were lost.</p>
            <p>The flash is there to save the day! Just store <code>flash[:success]</code> (or whatever you’d like it called) and it will be available to your view on the next new request. As soon as the view accesses the hash, Rails erases the data so you don’t have it show up every time the user hits a new page. So clean, so convenient.</p>
            <p>What about cases where the user can’t sign up because of failed validations? In this case, the typical <code>#create</code> action would just <code>render</code> the <code>#new</code> action using the existing instance variables. Since it’s not a totally new request, you’ll want to have your error message available immediately. That’s why there’s the handy <code>flash.now</code> hash, e.g. <code>flash.now[:error] = \"Fix your submission!\"</code>. Just like the regular flash, this one self destructs automatically after opening.</p>
            <p>You still have to write view code to display the flash messages. It’s common to write a short view helper that will pin any available flash message(s) to the top of the browser. You might also add a class to the message which will allow you to write some custom CSS, for instance turning <code>:success</code> messages green and <code>:error</code> messages red.</p>
            <pre><code class=\"language-html\">  # app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
            ...
            &lt;% flash.each do |name, message| %&gt;
                &lt;div class=\"&lt;%= name %&gt;\"&gt;&lt;%= message %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;% end %&gt;
            </code>
            </pre>
            <h3 id=\"controller-filters\">Controller Filters</h3>
            <p>Before we talk about authentication, we need to cover controller filters. The idea of these filters is to run some code in your controller at very specific times, for instance before any other code has been run. That’s important because, if a user is requesting to run an action they haven’t been authorized for, you need to nip that request in the bud and send back the appropriate error/redirect before they’re able to do anything else. You’re basically “filtering out” unauthorized requests.</p>
            <p>We do this through the use of a “before filter”, which takes the name of the method we want to run:</p>
            <pre><code class=\"language-ruby\">  # app/controllers/users_controller
            before_action :require_login
            ...
            private

            def require_login
                # do stuff to check if user is logged in
            end
            </code>
            </pre>
            <p>The <code>before_action</code> method takes the symbol of the method to run before anything else gets run in the controller. If it returns <code>false</code> or <code>nil</code>, the request will not succeed.</p>
            <p>You can specify to only apply the filter for specific actions by specifying the <code>only</code> option, e.g. <code>before_action :require_login, only: [:edit, :update]</code>. The opposite applies by using the <code>:except</code> option… it will run for all actions except those specified.</p>
            <p>You’ll want to hide your filter methods behind the <code>private</code> designation so they can only be used by that controller.</p>
            <p>Finally, filters are inherited so if you’d like a filter to apply to absolutely every controller action, put it in your <code>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</code> file.</p>
            <h3 id=\"authentication\">Authentication</h3>
            <p>The whole point of authentication is to make sure that the user is who they say they are. The standard way of managing this is through logging in your user via a sign in form. Once the user is logged in, you keep track of that user using the session until the user logs out.</p>
            <p>A related concept is authorization. Yes, you may be signed in, but are you actually authorized to access what you’re trying to access? The typical example is the difference between a regular user and an admin user. They both authenticate with the system but only the admin is authorized to make changes to certain things.</p>
            <p>Authentication and authorization go hand in hand – you first authenticate someone so you know who they are and can check if they’re authorized to view a page or perform an action. When you build your app, you’ll have a system of authentication to get the user signed in and to verify the user is who he says he is. You authorize the user to do certain things (like delete stuff) based on which methods are protected by controller filters that require signin or elevated permissions (e.g. admin status).</p>
            <h3 id=\"basic-and-digest-authentication\">Basic and Digest Authentication</h3>
            <p>If you’re looking for a very casual and insecure way of authenticating people, HTTP Basic authentication can be used. We won’t cover the details here, but it basically involves submitting a username and password to a simple form and sending it (unencrypted) across the network. You use the <code>#http_basic_authenticate_with</code> method to do so (see the reading for examples) and to restrict access to certain controllers without it.</p>
            <p>For a slightly more secure (over HTTP) authentication system, use HTTP Digest Authentication. We’ll again not cover it here. It relies on a <code>#before_action</code> running a method which calls upon <code>#authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest</code>, which takes a block that should return the “correct” password that should have been provided.</p>
            <p>The problem with both of these is that they hard code user names and passwords in your controller (or somewhere), so it’s really just a band-aid solution.</p>

            <p>If you want user logins, you’ll need to go through a few extra steps. We won’t cover them explicitly here because you’ll get a chance to do them in the project. A few principles are useful to know going in, though. The following stuff may seem a bit abrupt and devoid of examples, but it’s really just a preview of what you’ll be doing shortly in the project.</p>
            <p>First, we don’t store passwords in plain text in the database. That’s just asking for trouble (how many news stories have you seen about major sites getting hacked and passwords being exposed in plain text?). Instead, you’ll store an encrypted “password digest” version of the password.</p>
            <p>When a user submits their password via the login form, instead of comparing it directly with a plaintext version of that password, you actually convert the submitted password into digest form. You’ll then compare that new digest with the digest you’d previously stored from the user. If they match, you’ve got yourself a logged in user.</p>
            <p>This is much better because digests are one-way encryption. You can easily create a digest from a password string, but it’s extremely difficult to decrypt the digest and retrieve the original password. The most effective way to crack a bunch of digests is just to make a giant list of possible passwords, turn them into digests, and see if those digests match the one you’re trying to crack (i.e. guess-and-check on a massive scale).</p>
            <p>Rails doesn’t make you do everything yourself. It has a method called <code>#has_secure_password</code> which you just drop into your User model and it will add a lot of the functionality you’re looking for. To work with that handy method, you basically set up your User model to handle accepting <code>password</code> and <code>password_confirmation</code> attributes but you won’t actually persist those to the database. <code>has_secure_password</code> intercepts those values and converts them into the password digest for you.</p>
            <p>To initialize a new user session (when your user signs in), you’ll need to create a new controller (usually <code>sessions_controller.rb</code>) and the corresponding routes for <code>:new</code>, <code>:create</code> and <code>:destroy</code>. If the user passes the correct credentials (which we can check using the <code>#authenticate</code> method), you’ll use the <code>session</code> variable to store their ID, which you can use to validate that they are who they say they are. This is a simple way of authenticating the user that uses Rails’ existing session infrastructure, but only lasts as long as the session does.</p>
            <p>If your user wants to be “remembered” (you’ve probably seen the “remember me” checkbox plenty of times on login forms), you need a way to remember them for longer than just the length of the browser session. To do this, you’ll need to create another column in your Users table for an encrypted <code>remember_token</code> (or whatever you’d like to call it). You’ll use that to store a random string for that user that will be used in the future to identify him/her.</p>
            <p>You will drop the unencrypted token as a permanent cookie (using <code>cookies.permanent[:remember_token]</code>) into the user’s browser. That cookie will be submitted with each new request, so you can check with the encrypted version in the database to see who that user is whenever they make a request. This is basically a more explicit and permanent version of what Rails is doing with sessions. It’s best practice to reset the token on each new signin if the user signs out.</p>
            <p>It’s usually good to make some helper methods for yourself to cover common behavior like signing in a user, checking if a user is signed in, and comparing the currently signed in user with another user (useful if the current user is looking at another user’s page and shouldn’t see links to “edit” it). These things will make your life much easier since you can reuse them in your controller filters or your views or even your tests.</p>
            <p>A generic step-by-step overview:</p>
            <ol><li>Add a column to your Users table to contain the user’s <code>password_digest</code>.</li>
            <li>When the user signs up, turn the password they submitted into digest form and then store THAT in the new database column by adding the <code>has_secure_password</code> method to your User model.</li>
            <li>Don’t forget any necessary validations for password and password confirmation length.</li>
            <li>Build a sessions controller (and corresponding routes) and use the <code>#authenticate</code> method to sign in the user when the user has submitted the proper credentials using the signin form.</li>
            <li>Allow the user to be remembered by creating a <code>remember_token</code> column in the Users table and saving that token as a permanent cookie in the user’s browser. Reset on each new signin.</li>
            <li>On each page load that requires authentication (and using a <code>#before_action</code> in the appropriate controller(s)), first check the user’s cookie <code>remember_token</code> against the database to see if he’s already signed in. If not, redirect to the signin page.</li>
            <li>Make helper methods as necessary to let you do things like easily determine if a user is signed in or compare another user to the currently signed in user.</li>
            <li>Profit.</li>
            </ol><h3 id=\"devise\">Devise</h3>
            <p>Devise is a gem which has been built to handle all this stuff for you. It may be tempting to immediately dive into it, but that’s not a good idea for beginners. It’s first of all quite important to understand the basic steps of authentication. Devise can also get fairly complex if you start running into problems or nonstandard use cases. It’s more useful for intermediate+ users of Rails than beginners.</p>
            <p>That said, you’ll end up using it on most of your projects once you’ve mastered rolling your own authentication. It’s ultimately better than rolling your own auth because they’ve covered a lot of the edge cases and security loopholes that you might not think about. Devise lets you interface with more advanced authentication systems for talking to APIs like OAuth. So it’s quite useful down the road.</p>
            <p>In a short word, Devise prepackages for you a bunch of signin and signup forms and methods to help implement them. It’s made up of 10 modules (and you can choose which ones you want to use). You install the <code>devise</code> gem and run the installer to drop their files into your application. You’ll also need to run a database migration to add their additional fields to your Users table.</p>
            <p>Configuration will be dependent on your use case. Do you want to make the user confirm their signup using an email (the <code>Confirmable</code> module)? Do you want to allow the user to reset his password (the <code>Recoverable</code> module)?</p>
            <p>It’s beyond the scope of this lesson to teach Devise but you’ll certainly be using it by the end of the course. The trick is to read the documentation. They’ve got a fairly impressive set of docs available <a href=\"https://github.com/plataformatec/devise\">on Github</a>. The point of showing it here is for you to see it, read it, and keep it in the back of your head until you actually use it.</p>

            <h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Authentication can appear to be a fairly complicated topic – there are a lot of moving parts. At it’s core, though, you’re just checking whether the person making a request is actually a signed in user who has the permissions to do so, all by using browser cookies in some form or another.</p>
            <p>This lesson should have given you some appreciation for how complicated login systems can potentially get but it should also have removed the veil from the websites you’ve visited countless times. Auth isn’t rocket science and you’ll shortly be building it into your own applications.</p>

            "<div lang=\"en\"><p>Do you actually use data structures and algorithms on your day to day job? I've noticed a growing trend of people assuming algorithms are pointless questions that are asked by tech companies purely as an arbitrary measure. I hear more people complain about how all of this is a purely academic exercise. This notion was definitely popularized after Max Howell, the author of Homebrew, posted his Google interview experience:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.</p>
            — Max Howell (@mxcl) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"></a></blockquote>
            <p>While I've also never needed to use binary tree inversion, but I have come across everyday use cases of data structures and algorithms when <a href=\"https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/surprising-things-about-working-at-tech-unicorns/\">working at Skype/Microsoft, Skyscanner and Uber</a>. This included writing code and making decisions based on these concepts. But for the most part, I used this knowledge to understand how and why some things were built. Knowing these concepts made it easy to understand design and implementations referencing these.</p>
            <p><strong>This article is a set of real-world examples where data structures like trees, graphs, and various algorithms were used in production</strong>. I hope to illustrate that a generic data structures and algorithms knowledge is not \"just for the interview\" - but something that you'd likely find yourself reaching for when working at fast-growing, innovative tech companies. If you want to buy one book that teaches you everything you need to know for the majority of interviews, <strong><a href=\"https://geni.us/5v5U\">Grokking Algorithms</a></strong> is hands down the best guide.</p>
            <p>I've used a very small subset of algorithms, but almost all data structures. It should be of no surprise that I am no fan of algorithm-heavy and non-practical interview questions with exotic data types like Red-Black trees or AVL trees. Never asked these, and never will. You can read about what I think about these interviews at the <a href=\"https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/data-structures-and-algorithms-i-actually-used-day-to-day/#interviews-and-algorithms-and-data-structures\">end of this article</a>. Still, there is lots of value in being aware of what options for basic data types they can choose to tackle certain problems. With this, let's jump into examples.</p>
            <h2>Trees and tree traversing: Skype, Uber and UI frameworks</h2>
            <p>When we built Skype of Xbox One, we worked on a barebones Xbox OS, that was missing key libraries. We were building one of the first full-fledged applications on the platform. We needed a navigation solution that we could hook up both to touch gestures and to voice commands.</p>
            <p>We built a generic navigation framework on top of WinJS. To do so, we needed to maintain a DOM-like <strong>graph</strong> to keep track of the actionable elements. To find these elements, we did DOM traversal - basically, a <strong>tree</strong> traversal - across the existing DOM. This is a classic case of <strong>BFS</strong> or <strong>DFS</strong> (breadth-first search or depth-first search).</p>
            <p>If you're doing web development, you already work with a tree structure: the DOM. All DOM nodes can have children and the browser renders nodes on-screen after traversing the DOM tree. If you are searching for a specific element, you can use built-in DOM methods to find it - such as getElementById - or you could implement a BFS or DFS search to go through all the nodes, similar to how it's done <a href=\"https://www.softnami.com/posts_pr/traversing_the_html_dom_using_depth_and_breath_first_search.html\">in this example</a>.</p>
            <p>Many frameworks that render UI elements use tree structures behind the scenes. React maintains a virtual DOM, and uses smart <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html\">reconciliation</a> - a \"diffing\" algorithm - to deliver great performance, by only re-rendering parts of the screen that's changed. Ryan Bas visualizes this process <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ryanbas21/react-reconciliation-7075e3f07437\">in his writeup on React reconciliation</a>.</p>
            <p>Uber's mobile architecture, <a href=\"https://github.com/uber/RIBs\">RIBs</a> uses trees as well - similar to most UI frameworks that render elements in a hierarchy. RIBs maintains a RIB tree <a href=\"https://github.com/uber/RIBs/wiki#state-management\">for state management</a>, attaching and detaching the RIBs that need to be rendered. When working with RIBs, we would sometimes sketch where the new RIBs would fit in the hierarchy, and discuss whether the RIBs in question should have views - making it a part of the view hierarchy - or just manage state.</p>
            <div class=\"RIL_IMG\" id=\"RIL_IMG_1\">
            <figure>
            <img alt=\"State transitions in an example RIBs use case. See RIBs documentation and code here.\" src=\"https://pocket-image-cache.com//filters:no_upscale()/https%3A%2F%2Fblog.pragmaticengineer.com%2Fcontent%2Fimages%2F2020%2F07%2FScreenshot-2020-07-17-at-8.23.22.png\">
            <figcaption>State transitions in an example RIBs use case. See RIBs documentation and code here.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            </div><p>If you ever find yourself needing to build visualization of hirearchical elements, a common approach is to use a tree-like structure, traverse the tree and render the elements you visit. I've come across many internal tools that use this approach. An example is the RIBs visualization tool built by Uber's Mobile Platform team, that you can see in a demo <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfwZSk6VRVY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1635\">in this video</a>.</p>
            <h2>Weighed graphs and shortest paths: Skyscanner</h2>
            <p>Skyscanner finds the best deals on airline tickets. It does this by scanning all routes worldwide, then putting them together. While the nature of the problem is more on crawling, and less on caching - as airlines calculate the layover options - the multi-city planning option becomes the <strong>shortest path problem</strong>.</p>
            <p>Multi-city was one of the features that took Skyscanner quite a bit of time to build - in all fairness, the difficulty was more on the product side, than anything. The best multi-city deals are calculated by using shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra or A*. Flight routes are represented as a directed graph, with each edge having a weight of the cost of the ticket. Calculating the cheapest price option between two cities was done via an implementation of a modified <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm\"><strong>A* search algorithm</strong></a> per route. If you're interested in flights and shortest paths, the article on implementing the shortest flight search path using <strong>BFS</strong> <a href=\"https://medium.com/free-code-camp/exploring-the-applications-and-limits-of-breadth-first-search-to-the-shortest-paths-in-a-weighted-1e7b28b3307\">by Sachin Malhotra</a> is a good read.</p>
            <p>With Skyscanner, the actual algorithm was far less important, though. Caching, crawling, and handling the varying website load were much more difficult things to crack. Still, a variation of the shortest paths problem comes up with many several travel companies that optimize for price based on combinations. Unsurprisingly, this topic was also a source of hallway discussions here.</p>
            <h2>Sorting: Skype (kind of)</h2>
            <p>Sorting is an algorithm family I rarely had an excuse to implement or needed to use in-depth. It's interesting to understand the different types of ways to sort, from bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, selection sort and - the most complex one - quicksort. Still, I found that there is rarely a reason to implement any of this, especially when you don't need to write sort functions as part of a library.</p>
            <p>At Skype, I got to exercise a bit on this knowledge, though. One of the other engineers decided to implement an insertion sort for listing contacts. In 2013, when Skype connected to the network, contacts would arrive in bursts, and it would take some time for all the contacts to arrive. So this engineer thought it's more performant to build the contact list organized by name, using insertion sort. We had a back-and-forth on this, over why not just use the default sort algorithm. In the end, it was more work to properly test the implementation, and to benchmark it. I personally didn't see much point in doing so: but we were in the stage of the project that we had the time.</p>
            <p>There are definitely some real-world use cases where efficient sorting matters, and having control over what type of sorting you use, based on the data, can make a difference. Insertion sort can be useful when streaming realtime data in large chunks and building realtime visualization for these data sources. Merge sort can work well with divide-and-conquer approaches if it comes to large amounts of data stored on different nodes. I've not worked with these, so I'll still mark sorting algorithms as something with little day-to-day use, beyond the appreciation of the different approaches.</p>
            <h2>Hashtables and hashing: everywhere</h2>
            <p>The most frequent data structure I've used regularly was <strong>hashtables</strong> and the <strong>hashing function</strong>. It's such a handy tool from counting, to detecting duplications, to caching, all the way to <a href=\"https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/distributed-architecture-concepts-i-have-learned-while-building-payments-systems/#sharding-and-quorum\">distributed systems use cases like sharding</a>. After arrays, it's easily the most common data structure I've used on countless occasions. Almost all languages come with this data structure, and it's simple to implement if you'd need it.</p>
            <h2>Stacks and queues: every now and then</h2>
            <p>The <strong>stack</strong> data structure will be very familiar to anyone who has debugged a language that has a stack trace. As a data structure, I've had a few problems to use it for, but debugging and performance profiling makes me intricately familiar with it. It's also an obvious choice when traversing a tree depth-first.</p>
            <p>I rarely had to choose <strong>queues</strong> as data structures for my code, but I came across it plenty of times in codebases, code popping, or pushing values in it. A common use case is implementing BFS traversing of trees, where the queue data structure lends itself. You can also use queues for a variety of other use cases. I once read code scheduling jobs that made good use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue\">priority queues</a>, running the shortest jobs first, using the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html\">Python heap queue algorithm</a>.</p>
            <h2>Crypto: Uber</h2>
            <p>User-entered sensitive information coming from mobile or web clients needs to be encrypted before sending through the network, only to be decrypted on a specific service. To do so, a crypto approach needs to be implemented on the client and the backend.</p>
            <p>Understanding crypto is interesting. You don't come up with a new algorithm - this can be one of the worst ideas to do. Instead, you take an existing, well-documented standard and the use the framework built-in primitives. The standard of choice is usually a part of <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/197/final/documents/fips-197.pdf\">the AES standard</a>. If it's secure enough to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#Security\">encrypt classified US information</a>, and there is no known, working attack on the protocol, AES192 or AES256 is usually a secure enough choice for most use cases.</p>
            <p>When I joined Uber, mobile and web crypto were already implemented on top of these primitives, giving me the excuse to look up details of the Advanced Encryption Standard (<strong>AES</strong>), Hashed Message Authentication Codes (<strong>HMAC</strong>), the <strong>RSA</strong> public-key encryption and others. Understanding how a series of encryption steps are provably secure was another interesting area. Between encrypt-and-MAC, MAC-then-encrypt, and encrypt-then-MAC, only <a href=\"http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-06-24-encrypt-then-mac.html\">one of them is provably secure</a> - even though this doesn't mean the others are not secure.</p>
            <p>Implementing crypto primitives is rarely ever something you will ever need to do - unless building a brand new core framework. However, deciding on which primitives to use, how to combine primitives is a decision you might face - or have to understand why a certain approach was taken.</p>
            <h2>Decision trees: Uber</h2>
            <p>On one of the projects, we had to implement complex business logic in the mobile application. Based on half a dozen rules, we had to display one of several different screens. The rules were unusually complex due to a series of compliance checks and user choices that we needed to take into account.</p>
            <p>The engineer building this feature first tried to code the rules with a series of if-else statements, which got too complex. In the end, they decided to go with a decision tree, as it was easy to validate with product and compliance, reasonable to implement and easy to change, if needed. We needed to build an implementation for edges to execute rules, but this was about it. While we could have saved implementing this tree with a different approach, the team found this solution to be easier to maintain, going forward. Here's how the decision tree looked like - the edges being results of rules executed (either binary outcome or value ranges) and the leaf nodes marking what screen to transition to.</p>

            </figure>
            </div><p>Uber's mobile build system, called SubmitQueue, also utilizes decision trees built on the fly. The Developer Experience team had to solve the difficult problem of hundreds of mobile merges happening each day, with each build needing around 30 minutes to run - compiling, the running unit, integration, and UI tests. Parallelizing the builds was not a good enough solution, as two builds would often have overlapping changes, and a merge conflict would occur. In practice, this meant sometimes engineers would have to wait 2-3 hours, rebasing and staring the merge process again, and hoping there would be no conflict.</p>
            <p>The Developer Experience team took an innovative approach by predicting merge conflicts and queued builds accordingly, using speculation graphs. Speculation graphs are very similar to binary decision trees:</p>

Adrian Colyer also has a nice, <a href=\"https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/04/18/keeping-master-green-at-scale/\">visual analysis on the approach</a>. The result was a much faster build system that optimized build time, and made the lives of hundreds of mobile engineers far more pleasant.</p>
            <h2>Hexagonal Grids, Hierarchical Indexes: Uber</h2>
            <p>This last project is one I've come about purely based on stumbling across it. I learned about a new data structure: hexagonal grids with hierarchical indexes.</p>
            <p>One of the most difficult and interesting problems to solve at Uber is how to optimize the pricing of trips, and the dispatching of partners. Prices can be dynamic, and drivers are constantly on the move. <a href=\"https://eng.uber.com/h3/\">H3</a> is a grid system engineers built to both visualize and analyze data across cities, at an increasingly granular level. The data - and visualization - structure for this is a hexagonal grid with hierarchical indexes, and a couple of internal visualization tools are built on top of it.</p>

            </div><p>The data structure has specific indexing, traversal, hierarchical grid, region, and unidirectional edge functions, <a href=\"https://h3geo.org/docs/api/indexing\">detailed in the API reference</a>. For a more detailed deep-dive, see the <a href=\"https://eng.uber.com/h3/\">article on the H3 library</a>, the <a href=\"https://github.com/uber/h3\">source code</a>, or the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=768&amp;v=ay2uwtRO3QE&amp;feature=emb_title\">presentation</a> on how and why this tool was built.</p>
            <p>What I really liked about this experience is learning that creating your own specialized data structures can make sense in a niche area. There aren't many use cases where hexagonal grids with hierarchical indexes would make sense beyond combining mapping with various data levels within each cell. Still, if you're familiar with some data structures, understanding this new data structure is much easier - as it would be for you to design yet another data structure for a similarly specialized need.</p>
            <h2>Interviews and algorithms and data structures</h2>
            <p>Those were the highlights of the actual data structures and algorithms I've come across professionally between multiple companies and many years. So let's go back to the original tweet that complained about asking things like inverting a binary tree on a whiteboard. I'm on Max's side on this one.</p>
            <p><strong>Knowing how popular algorithms or exotic data structures work are not something you should need to know to work at a tech company.</strong> You should know what an algorithm is, and should be able to come up with simple ones on your own, like a greedy one. You should also know about basic data structures that are pretty common, like hashtables, queues, or stacks. But specific algorithms like Dijkstra, A* and more advanced ones are not things you'd need to memorize: you'll have a reference for this. The most I did with algorithms beyond sorting was look them up and understand them myself. Same with exotic data structures like Red-Black trees or AVL trees. I've never had to use these data structures. Even if I did, I would look them up again. I have never asked questions that needed this kind of knowledge to solve them, and never will.</p>
            <p>I am all for asking practical coding exercises, where there are many good solutions, from brute force or greedy approaches to potentially more sophisticated ones. For example, asking to implement a justify text function <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/\">like this question</a> is a fair one: it's something I did when building a text rendering component on Windows Phone. You can solve this problem just by using an array and a few if/else statements, without any fancy data structures.</p>
            <p><strong>The reality is that many teams and companies are going overboard with algorithmic challenges.</strong> I can see the appeal of algorithmic questions: they give you signal in 45 minutes or less, and questions can be easily swapped around; thus, there is little harm if the question leaks. They are also easy to scale when recruiting, as you can have a question pool of 100+ questions, and any interviewer can evaluate any of them. Especially in Silicon Valley, it is more and more common to hear questions geared for dynamic programming or exotic data structures. These questions will help hire strong engineers - but also result in turning away people who would have excelled at a job that doesn't need advanced algorithms knowledge.</p>
            <p>To anyone reading whose company has a bar to hire people who know some of the advanced algorithms by heart: think again if this is what you need. I've hired fantastic teams at Skyscanner London and Uber Amsterdam without any tricky algorithm questions, covering no more than data structures and problem solving. You shouldn't need to know algorithms by heart. What you do need is awareness of the most common data structures and the ability to come up with simple algorithms to solve the problem at hand, as a toolset.</p>
            <h2>Data structures and algorithms are a toolset</h2>
            <p>If you work in a fast-moving, innovative tech company, you will almost certainly come across all sorts of data structures and different algorithm implementations in the codebase. When you build new and innovative solutions, you will often find yourself reaching to the right data structure. This is when you'll want to be aware of the options to choose from and their tradeoffs.</p>
            <p><strong>Data structures and algorithms are a tool that you should use with confidence when building software</strong>. Know these tools, and you'll be familiar with navigating codebases that use them. You'll also be far more confident in how to implement solutions to hard problems. You'll know the theoretical limits, the optimizations you can make, and you'll come up with solutions that are as good as they get - all tradeoffs considered.</p>
            <p>To get started, I recommend the following resources:</p>
            <ul><li>Read up on the hashtable, linked list, tree, graphs, heap, queue, and stack data structures. Play around with how to can use them in your language. GeeksforGeeks has a <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overview-of-data-structures-set-1-linear-data-structures/?ref=lbp\">good overview on these</a>. For coding practice, I'd recommend the <a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures\">HackerRank Data Structures collection</a>.</li>

            "<div lang=\"en\"><p>Complicated stuff can stem from a handful of common roots. Understanding those common roots can be more important than trying to wrap your head around complexity.</p>
            <p>To show you what I mean, let me tell you a story about stories.</p>
            <hr><p>Tens of millions of fictional stories have been published, written by authors of every age, culture, and life experience that exists. Most never knew each other or read each other’s work. Their stories range from prehistoric battles to science fiction. Stories are perhaps the most diverse things our imaginations have ever created.</p>
            <p>But all of these stories – every story, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2PINhmU\">according to</a> author Christopher Booker – take shape in remarkably similar ways.</p>
            <p>“There are a small number of plots which are so fundamental to the way we tell stories that it is virtually impossible for any storyteller ever entirely to break away from them,” Booker writes.</p>
            <p>He argues only seven plots exist in the history of fictional storytelling: 1. Overcoming Monsters, 2. Rags to Riches, 3. The Quest, 4. Voyage and Return, 5. Rebirth, 6. Comedy, and 7. Tragedy.</p>
            <p>It’s not that all stories are the same. It’s that the plots that make good stories are less diverse than the characters and scenes that populate good stories. And the plots that catch readers’ attention are psychological common denominators among all of us, so the seven plots show up in stories told by cultures that have little in common.</p>
            <p>This is more than a casual observation. It’s a window into how people think. Booker writes:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Whereas we are prepared to devote untold physical and mental resources to reaching out into the furthest recesses of the galaxy – in an attempt, as we like to think, to plumb every last secret of the universe – one of the greatest and most important mysteries is lying so close beneath our noses that we scarcely even recognise it to be a mystery at all … once we become acquainted with this symbolic language, there is literally no story in the world which cannot then be seen in a new light: because we have come to the heart of what stories are about and why we tell them.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This point applies to many fields.</p>
            <p>Try to learn about people using a bottom-up approach of analyzing every character and scene from every culture and you will drown in complexity and anecdotes. There are too many stories, and even within a single culture the specific details of what people believe can be contradictory and filled with nuance. A top-down approach – looking for a few universal plot patterns – can be more useful, because it reveals things fundamental to how all people think, which are likely to be repeated in the future and relevant to your own situation.</p>
            <p>Booker’s insight is that you will better understand the characters and scenes from individual stories if you first appreciate the universal plots that show up in all stories.</p>
            <p>Which is an idea relevant to anyone interested in how the economy works.</p>
            <p>Economic history is complicated because it’s more than economics. It’s part politics, psychology, sociology, criminology, biology, military, technology, art, engineering, education, finance, etc.</p>
            <p>But within that tangle of complexity – different people from different cultures and different eras – is a lot of commonality.</p>
            <p>People tend to want the same economic things – security, power, admiration, fulfillment.</p>
            <p>They tend to use the same tactics to get those things – work, risk, incentives, persuasion, theft, control.</p>
            <p>And they tend to fall for the same flaws in pursuit of those things – overconfidence, pessimism, no room for error, underestimating how fast things can change, etc.</p>
            <p>Economic history may be complicated. But the common denominators of human behavior means there are, if you look, only a handful of broad story plots that pop up again and again, throughout history and around the globe, connecting the economic experiences of people who otherwise seem to have little in common.</p>
            <p>To better understand the characters and scenes from individual economic stories, we must first appreciate the universal plots that show up in all stories.</p>
            <p>Here are five.</p>
            <hr><p><strong>Plot 1:</strong> <strong>A good idea taken to the furthest extreme becomes indistinguishable from a terrible idea</strong>.</p>
            <p>A rule of thumb holds that no technological breakthrough is so important that it can’t be overdosed on. And a common plot in economic history is that the most important technological breakthroughs deliver such a high that they will, in fact, be overdosed on. Money and brains are attracted to good ideas more than they are capable of knowing the limits of good ideas.</p>
            <p>Take railroads.</p>
            <p>A one-word telegraph was sent at noon on May 10th, 1869, across the United States. “DONE” it said. The transcontinental railroad was finished.</p>
            <p>It’s hard to overstate how big a deal this was. Technology sat at such a low baseline in the 1860s that the railroad age transformed the nation in ways that are hard to imagine today. Historian Stephen Ambrose writes:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>This was the first time that news of an epochal event had been greeted with such celebration by so many people at the same time: Across the nation, bells pealed. Even the venerable Liberty Bell in Philadelphia was rung. Then came the boom of cannons, 220 of them in San Francisco, a hundred in Washington, D. C., countless fired off elsewhere. It was said that more cannons were fired in celebration than ever took part in the Battle of Gettysburg.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>To understand how important railroads were in the 19th century you have to consider life before their arrival. The biggest change the average American saw from the rail age was not their ability to travel; it was their diet. Historian Robert Gordon:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>In most parts of the United States people were virtually without fresh fruit and green vegetables from late autumn to late spring. The result was that innumerable Americans were in sluggish health during the months of late winter and early spring, when their diet was short of vitamins.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Railroads changed this. “A major change between the 1890s and 1920s was the increasing availability of fresh vegetables in the winter as a result of refrigerated railroad cars,” writes Gordon.</p>
            <p>Rails transformed every inch of the economy, from military tactics to where people could live and work. It was for physical goods what the internet is for information. Few inventions were as powerful in their ability to deliver life-changing value to the masses as railroads were in the 19th century.</p>
            <p>Interesting, then, how many railroad investors lost their shirts during this period. It’s only a small exaggeration to say the number of railroad investors who prospered during this time rounds to zero.</p>
            <p>Excitement over rail’s potential sparked overbuilding and cutthroat competition that pulled the country into economic chaos at least three times. Railroads created booms and busts that make the 2000s housing bubble look tame. More than half of all rail companies were bankrupt by 1894. At times the overbuilding turned into madness, with identical tracks built side by side. Historian Robert Gordon again:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Nearly twenty new miles of track a day, on average, were built for thirty years. In contrast to the single transcontinental line from Omaha to Sacramento linked together in the historic 1869 ceremony, by 1893 there were seven transcontinental lines, of which three were relatively close together, traversing Kansas and Nebraska, and two were quite close together in their paths through the sparsely populated Dakotas and Montana.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The book <em>Lords of Creation</em> describes the economic battles:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>During the 1880s competition among the railroads got completely out of hand; it was easy for daring and unscrupulous plungers to build new lines simply as a form of economic blackmail—in order to be bought off by their competitors in self-defense; at one time there were five lines bidding against each other for the traffic between New York and Chicago, two more were under construction, and the passenger fare for the through trip had been beaten down to the ruinous figure of one dollar.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The history of oil, cars, banks, housing, and technology are identical.</p>
            <p>Same for certain regulations, deregulations, social programs, management principles and business strategies.</p>
            <p>Good ideas get pushed to bad levels. The characters and scenes change throughout history, but the plot is timeless.</p>
            <p>This is not a flaw of capitalism. Being overconfident in your abilities and overoptimistic about your opportunities can be a useful intellectual shield, keeping you motivated in a world where most things are so hard that a coldly rational person might refuse to take any risk. And all economic opportunities will be exploited beyond their capacity, <a href=\"https://www.collaborativefund.com/uploads/Collaborative%20Fund%20--%20The%20Reasonable%20Formation%20of%20Unreasonable%20Things2.pdf\">because if markets never crashed</a> they wouldn’t be risky. And if they weren’t risky they would get really expensive. And when they get really expensive they crash. That’s why this plot persists.</p>
            <p>Few economic ideas are inherently good. At best, things are good at one level and ruinous at another.</p>
            <hr><p><strong>Plot 2: A competitive advantage that once looked invincible is squandered.</strong></p>
            <p>The only thing harder than gaining a competitive edge is not losing an advantage when you have one.</p>
            <p>If you were a movie scriptwriter and had to dream up a fake company with the strongest competitive advantage you can imagine you would probably come up with something that looks like what Sears was in real life in the 1970s.</p>
            <p>Sears was the largest retailer in the world, housed in the tallest building in the world, employing one of the largest workforces.</p>
            <p>“No one has to tell you you’ve come to the right place. The look of merchandising authority is complete and unmistakable,” <em>The New York Times</em> wrote of Sears in 1983.</p>
            <p>Sears was so good at retailing that in the 1970s and ‘80s it ventured into other areas, like finance. It owned Allstate Insurance, Discover credit card, the Dean Witter brokerage for your stocks and Coldwell Banker brokerage for your house.</p>
            <p>Sears was, in almost every way, the Amazon of its day: so dominant at retailing efficiency that it could spread its magic into unrelated industries, where it’d terrify rivals. <em>The Times</em> wrote in 1974:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>“Donald T. Regan, chairman of Merrill Lynch … indicated yesterday that the firm sees itself eventually as a Sears, Roebuck of the investment business. “We must get as efficient as possible to keep costs to the consumer down,” he said. “That’s what made Sears a success, and that’s a rule we must keep in mind.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>And then everything fell to pieces.</p>
            <p>Growing income inequality pushed consumers to either bargain or luxury goods, leaving Sears in the shrinking middle. Competition from Wal-Mart and Target – younger and hungrier – took off.</p>
            <p>By the late 2000s Sears was a shell of its former self. “YES, WE ARE OPEN” a sign outside my local Sears read – a reminder to customers who had all but written it off.</p>
            <p>The story of how Sears lost its competitive advantage is fascinating. But it is not unique. It is in many ways the default outcome of once-dominant companies.</p>
            <p>Going public is a sign that a company has found enough competitive advantage to scale into a large corporation. But almost 40% of all public companies <a href=\"https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/risk/\">lost all of their value</a> from 1980 to 2014. The list of top-10 Fortune 500 companies that went bankrupt includes General Motors, Chrysler, Kodak – and Sears. Those indistinguishable from their former selves is longer, and includes General Electric, Time Warner, AIG and Motorola. Countries follow similar fates. At various points in the past the world’s scientific and economic progress has been dominated by China, Amsterdam, and the Middle East.</p>
            <p>Whenever a once-powerful thing loses an advantage it once it had it is tempting to ridicule the mistakes of its leaders. But it’s easy to overlook how many forces pull you away from a competitive advantage once you have one, specifically <em>because</em> you have one. Success has its own gravity. “The higher the monkey climbs a tree, the more you can see his ass,” T. Boone Pickens used to say.</p>
            <p>Five things contribute to the gravitational pull of competitive advantages.</p>
            <p>One is that being right instills confidence that you can’t be wrong, which is a devastating characteristic in a world where outlier success has a target on its back with competitors chasing in tow.</p>
            <p>Another is that success tends to lead to growth – usually by design – but a big organization is a different animal than a small one, and strategies that led to success at one size can be impossible at another. There is a long history of star fund managers from one decade underperforming in the next. Some of this is the unraveling of luck. But success also attracts capital, and a big fund can’t do some things a small fund can. The career version of this is the Peter Principle: talented people will keep getting promoted until they’re in over their head.</p>
            <p>A third is the irony that people often work hard to gain a competitive advantage for the express purpose of not having to work so hard at some point in the future. Hard work is in pursuit of a goal, and once that goal is met the relaxation that feels so justified removes paranoia that lets competitors and a changing world to creep in unnoticed.</p>
            <p>A fourth is a skill that’s valuable in one era may not extend to the next. You can work as hard and be as paranoid as you’ve always been, but if the world no longer values your skill, it’s a loss.</p>
            <p>And one-trick pony-ism is common, because a top reason competitive advantages were once valuable is an unshakable devotion to one big idea while rejecting all others.</p>
            <p>The last is that some success is owed to being in the right place at the right time. The reversion to reality that unmasks good luck is often only obvious with hindsight, and is both humbling and tempting to refuse to believe.</p>
            <p>The idea that advantage has a shelf life is a fundamental part of growth. It doesn’t have to be a tragedy – not all competitive advantages end like Sears. Great Britain lost the economic and military supremacy it held in the 19th century, but remained a pretty nice place to live in the 20th.</p>
            <hr><p><strong>Plot 3: Future progress is underrated because past progress is misunderstood.</strong></p>
            <p>There are times like the late 1990s when optimism is so great and so broad that we become blind to future risks. Here’s President Clinton <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-before-joint-session-the-congress-the-state-the-union-7\">in the 2000</a> State of the Union address – a year before September 11th and a new recession:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>We are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history. Never before has our Nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis and so few external threats. Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity and, therefore, such a profound obligation to build the more perfect Union of our Founders’ dreams.</p>
            <p>My fellow Americans, the state of our Union is the strongest it has ever been.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Despite centuries of progress and growth, these moods are an outlier. Pessimism over what lies ahead is far more common.</p>
            <p>Gallup has been asking Americans for more than four decades, “Are you satisfied with the way things are going in the U.S. right now?”</p>
            <p>The average percent of Americans answering “no” since 1969 is 63%.</p>
            <p>What’s interesting is that Gallup asks a follow-up question: “Are you satisfied with the way things are going in your own life right now?”</p>
            <p>There, the average “no” response is just 15.8%.</p>
            <p>People tend to feel good about themselves but pessimistic about others. This helps explain why the congressional reelection rate is so high when the approval rate is so low: most people approve of their own congress member but despise everyone else’s. It creates a situation where most people you know are probably reasonably happy, but pessimism over the direction of the country and its future remains stubbornly high. And when people are pessimistic about others, a natural path is to discount what those other people are capable of in the future.</p>
            <p>This was true in the early 1900s, when people <a href=\"https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-wonders-of-the-future/\">asked if the age of invention</a> – led by people like Thomas Edison – was over, a lucky blip that couldn’t repeat.</p>
            <p>It was true in 1950, when we wondered if the advent of the nuclear bomb would cast humanity back into the stone age.</p>
            <p>It’s been true in the last decade when, as data scientist Jeff Hammerbacher put it, “The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That sucks.”</p>
            <p>The pessimists may be right one day. Squandering a competitive advantage is a common plot after all.</p>
            <p>But underestimating future growth – particularly of people in general, not necessarily individual companies or countries – is also a common plot, for a few reasons.</p>
            <p>One is that viewing past progress as a one-time miracle misses how much of progress is incremental. If you think the computer, the airplane, or the internet were just “invented,” of course you’ll be pessimistic about our ability to do anything as meaningful in the future. They look like one-in-a-billion discoveries that can’t be repeated. But breakthroughs never occur in isolation. They’re the product of countless little discoveries – often meaningless on their own – that someone eventually ties together. Thomas Edison told this to a pessimistic newspaper reporter in 1908:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>You can never tell what apparently small discovery will lead to. Somebody discovers something and immediately a host of experimenters and inventors are playing all the variations upon it. Take Faraday’s experiments with copper disks. Looked like a scientific plaything, didn’t it? Well, it eventually gave us the trolly car. Or take Crooke’s tubes; looked like an academic discovery, but we got the X-ray from it. A whole host of experimenters are at work today; what great things their discoveries will lead to, no one can foretell.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>More recently, Safi Bahcall wrote in his book <em>Loonshots</em> about the origins of Polaroid film:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Sick dogs that were fed quinine to treat parasites showed an unusual type of crystal in their urine. Those microscopic crystals, called herapathite, turned out to be the highest-quality polarizers ever discovered.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>When it’s never obvious what little discoveries of the day will eventually merge into big ones, it’s easy to assume that there will be no big ones. Which is almost always wrong.</p>
            <p>Another reason is the assumption that the existence of big current problems will prohibit future progress. What this misses is that most progress – particularly technological breakthroughs – feed off big current problems. The push to solve problems rises when there’s a panicked necessity like a war or recession that requires solutions to problems immediately. Comfortable lives incentivize more utopian visions of the future than they do late nights in the laboratory. The back-to-back Great Depression, World War II, and Cold War are three of the worst things that happened in the 20th century. They also <a href=\"https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/careful-what-you-wish-for/\">sparked the greatest scientific discoveries</a> of the 20th century.</p>
            <p>Last, in real time it almost always looks like progress over the previous decade or so has stalled, seeming to verify that we’ve reached the limit of our innovation. The 1960s brought the computer. The 1970s, the microprocessor. The 1980s, the PC. 1990s, the internet. The 2000s, mobile. The 2010s … I don’t know, viral GIFs? This same plot can be repeated at almost any point in history with different characters. The reason the near past always looks less innovative than the further past is because it <a href=\"https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/when-you-change-the-world-and-no-one-notices/\">often takes a decade or more</a> for breakthroughs to be noticed. The best work of the last decade won’t be recognized for years to come.</p>
            <hr><p><strong>Plot 4: Surprises are constant, and not necessarily because we’re bad at predicting, but because everything important in the economy is driven by power laws where a tiny portion of things are responsible for the majority of outcomes, and it’s impossible for any one forecaster to track every moving part.</strong></p>
            <p>Fifteen billion people were born in the 19th and 20th centuries. But try to imagine how different the world would be today if just seven of them never existed:</p>
            <ul><li>
            <p>Adolf Hitler</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Joseph Stalin</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Mao Zedong</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Thomas Edison</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Bill Gates</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Martin Luther King</p>
            </li>
            </ul><p>I’m not sure that’s the most meaningful list. But almost everything about the world today – from borders to technology to social norms – would be different if these seven people hadn’t left their mark. Another way to put this is that 0.00000000004% of people were responsible for perhaps the majority of the world’s direction over the last century.</p>
            <p>The same goes for projects, innovations, and events. Imagine the last century without:</p>
            <ul><li>
            <p>The Manhattan Project</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Vaccines</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Antibiotics</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>September 11th</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>The fall of the Soviet Union</p>
            </li>
            </ul><p>How many projects and events occurred in the 20th century? Billions, trillions – who knows. But those six alone impacted the world orders upon orders of magnitude more than others.</p>
            <p>The thing that makes tail events easy to underappreciate is how easy it is to underestimate how things compound. How, for example, 9/11 prompted the Fed to cut interest rates, which helped drive the housing bubble, which led to the financial crisis, which led to a poor jobs market, which led tens of millions to seek a college education, which led to $1.6 trillion in student loans with a 10.8% default rate. It’s not intuitive to link 19 hijackers to the current weight of student loans, but such is the power of compounding in a tail-driven world. And you can, I believe, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=three/+big/+things&amp;oq=three/+big/+things&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4j69i60j69i61j69i60.1858j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">tie the majority of what’s happening</a> in the world today to just a handful of past events.</p>
            <p>The most common plot of economic history is the role of surprises. The reason surprises occur is not because our models are wrong or our intelligence is low. It’s because the odds that Adolf Hitler’s parents argued on the evening nine months he was born were the same as them conceiving a child. Technology is hard to predict because Bill Gates may have died from polio if Jonas Salk got cranky and gave up on his quest to find a vaccine. The reason we couldn’t predict the student loan growth is because an airport security guard may have confiscated a hijacker’s knife on 9/11. That’s all there is to it.</p>
            <p>In those alternative worlds another monster may have risen in Hitler’s absence, another tech genius may have become the Bill Gates of their day, and without 9/11 we may still have tripped into a financial crisis. Imagining an alternative world without the tail events we’ve had isn’t to say the world could have been better or worse – just that it would have been very different. And when a little difference in one era compounds into a massive change in another, surprises become a recurring plot in economic history.</p>
            <hr><p><strong>Plot 5:</strong> <strong>The ability to believe things that aren’t true or haven’t happened yet is the foundation of all economic growth and decline.</strong></p>
            <p>Stories of things happening are not as common as things happening because of stories.</p>
            <p>In his book <em>Fantasyland</em>, Kurt Andersen argues that a founding virtue of America is its willingness, if not desire, to believe things that aren’t true.</p>
            <p>It started with the whole idea of the New World, when 16th century Europeans were told of a magical land across the Atlantic filled with abundance, only to find a malarial swamp when they arrived.</p>
            <p>It continued with the Salem Witch trials, onto modern things like P.T. Barnum and Hollywood.</p>
            <p>“From the start, our ultra-individualism was attached to epic dreams and epic fantasies—every citizen was free to believe absolutely anything, or to pretend to be absolutely anybody,” Andersen writes.</p>
            <p>Every society tells fictional stories and is willing to believe them to some degree. But Americans’ propensity to believe in things that aren’t yet verified or are easily debunked with the known science is in many ways not only unparalleled, but foundational to the whole idea of this country.</p>
            <p>And a willingness to believe in things that haven’t happened isn’t always a bad thing. It’s the root of most growth. Most economic growth comes from optimism, and optimism requires a degree of believing in things you can not or have not yet verified. The ability to believe in things that aren’t yet real to such a degree that you spend your life chasing them is a characteristic we might take for granted. But it’s responsible for most of the things we get to enjoy in real life.</p>
            <p>And some of the stuff we’re embarrassed about, too.</p>
            <p>A quirk breakthrough technology is that it’s a big deal because no one had thought of it before, and no one thinking of it before means it’s likely either illogical or appears to violate previously accepted rules. So pursuing a breakthrough – as an entrepreneur, investor, or consumer – requires taking a leap of faith in your own abilities, or those of someone else, often a stranger.</p>
            <p>So no one should be surprised when some of those leaps of faith end up wrong. Well-meaning leaps of faith fail because the odds of success were low to begin with. Others fail because we took a leap of faith on someone whose claims couldn’t be verified and <a href=\"https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/theranos-lessons/\">it turns out they were</a> misleading all along. Whatever the reason, a willingness to believe in things that aren’t true accounts for the majority of why businesses fail, investors underperform, careers implode, and countries decline. We’ve had good growth, good productivity, great innovation. With that comes a mountain of stories of people who were wrong in their views. Those two things don’t repel each other; they work hand in hand.</p>
            <p>Stock markets owe most of their value to future earnings, which are merely a story.</p>
            <p>WeWork’s $47 billion was also built on a story.</p>
            <p>Steve Jobs told a story. So did Elizabeth Holmes.</p>
            <p>Capitalism – <a href=\"https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-greatest-story-ever-told/\">that’s a whole story in itself</a>.</p>
            <p>The counterintuition that the same storytelling traits that enable growth also ensure occasional decline is one of the most fascinating and recurring plots of economic history. The stories we tell and believe about the economy are more powerful and important than any tangible thing we have in the economy, and if you remove the role of luck, most of the difference in outcomes between people and countries is owed to differences in the ability to tell and believe stories. German author Elias Canette wrote:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>The largest crowds are drawn by the storytellers. It is around them that the people throng most densely and stay longest… their words come from further off and hang longer in the air than those of ordinary people.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Which brings us back to where this story began, with <em>The Seven Plots</em>. It argues all stories, however diverse, are just vehicles for one of a few basic human urges to travel upon. The better you understand a few common story plots that control our economy, the more sense you can make of the diverse cast of characters.</p>

            <figure><div class=\"RIL_IMG\" id=\"RIL_IMG_2\">
            <figure>
            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://pocket-image-cache.com//filters:no_upscale()/https%3A%2F%2Fneilkakkar.com%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fsapiens-timeline-1.jpg\">
            </figure>
            </div></figure><p>What caused our brains to develop? We’re not sure.</p>
            <p>It doesn’t seem likely. A larger brain needs more energy and thus reduces the chance you’ll survive. Getting more energy meant hunting more.</p>
            <p>One contributing factor was the domestication of fire. Fire paved the way for cooking.</p>
            <p>Whereas chimpanzees spend 5 hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food. The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines. Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain. Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it’s hard to have both. By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains.</p>
            <p>And, we weren’t alone. Competing with us were the Neanderthals, among other species. They were stronger, they had bigger brains, and they could survive the cold. How come, then, did we “win”?</p>
            <p>We aren’t sure. The most likely answer is the very thing that makes the debate possible: Homo sapiens conquered the world thanks above all to its unique language.</p>
            <h2>Cognitive Revolution</h2>
            <figure><div class=\"RIL_IMG\" id=\"RIL_IMG_3\">
            <figure>
            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://pocket-image-cache.com//filters:no_upscale()/https%3A%2F%2Fneilkakkar.com%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fsapiens-timeline-2.jpg\">
            </figure>
            </div></figure><p>The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. What caused it? We’re not sure. The most commonly believed theory argues that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using a new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation.</p>
            <p>What’s special about our language?</p>
            <p>Our language is amazingly supple. We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. We can thereby ingest, store and communicate a prodigious amount of information about the surrounding world. A monkey can yell to its comrades, ‘Careful! A lion!’ But a modern human can tell her friends that this morning, near the bend in the river, she saw a lion tracking a herd of bison. She can then describe the exact location, including the different paths leading to the area. With this information, the members of her band can put their heads together and discuss whether they ought to approach the river in order to chase away the lion and hunt the bison.</p>
            <p>Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled.</p>
            <p>Using language, lots of humans could work together, form a tribe, help each other, and hunt together.</p>
            <p>However, communicating with lots of people brings with it new co-ordination problems. The critical threshold for a group interacting together is 150 people.</p>
            <p>How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. This is an imagined reality.</p>
            <p>Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long as this communal belief persists, the imagined reality exerts force in the world.</p>
            <p>In other words, while the behaviour patterns of archaic humans remained fixed for tens of thousands of years, Sapiens could transform their social structures, the nature of their interpersonal relations, their economic activities and a host of other behaviours within a decade or two.</p>
            <p>For example, consider trade. Trade cannot exist without trust, and it is very difficult to trust strangers. The global trade network of today is based on our trust in such fictional entities as the dollar, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the totemic trademarks of corporations. When two strangers in a tribal society want to trade, they will often establish trust by appealing to a common god, mythical ancestor or totem animal.</p>
            <p>Our Tree of Knowledge mutation was significant. However, it’s not just our biology that brought us where we are today.</p>
            <ol><li>
            <p>Biology sets the basic parameters for the behaviour and capacities of Homo sapiens. The whole of history takes place within the bounds of this biological arena.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>This arena is extraordinarily large, allowing Sapiens to play an astounding variety of games. Thanks to their ability to invent fiction, Sapiens create more and more complex games, which each generation develops and elaborates even further</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Consequently, in order to understand how Sapiens behave, we must describe the historical evolution of their actions.</p>
            </li>
            </ol><h2>Agricultural Revolution</h2>
            <figure><div class=\"RIL_IMG\" id=\"RIL_IMG_4\">
            <figure>
            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://pocket-image-cache.com//filters:no_upscale()/https%3A%2F%2Fneilkakkar.com%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fsapiens-timeline-3.jpg\">
            </figure>
            </div></figure><p>The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes. Just as the economic success of a company is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees, so the evolutionary success of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA. If no more DNA copies remain, the species is extinct, just as a company without money is bankrupt. If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species flourishes. From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than a hundred copies. This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.</p>
            <p>Rather than heralding a new era of easy living, the Agricultural Revolution left farmers with lives generally more difficult and less satisfying than those of foragers. Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.</p>
            <p>Compared to foraging, working a bit harder on the farm meant more food. Settling down on the farm also meant greater freedom to reproduce - you’re not travelling all the time, so you can afford to have more children. This in turn, meant a higher population. And a higher population meant higher food requirements. Thus, the farmers were forced to work even harder.</p>
            <p>Why didn’t humans abandon farming when the plan backfired? Partly because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate and transform society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently. And partly because population growth burned humanity’s boats. If the adoption of ploughing increased a village’s population from a hundred to 110, which ten people would have volunteered to starve so that the others could go back to the good old times? There was no going back. The trap snapped shut.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and spawn new obligations</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This discrepancy between evolutionary success and individual suffering is perhaps the most important lesson we can draw from the Agricultural Revolution. When we study the narrative of plants such as wheat and maize, maybe the purely evolutionary perspective makes sense. Yet in the case of animals such as cattle, sheep and Sapiens, each with a complex world of sensations and emotions, we have to consider how evolutionary success translates into individual experience.</p>
            <h3>Imagined Realities - Solving the co-ordination problem</h3>
            <p>According to the science of biology, people were not ‘created’. They have evolved. And they certainly did not evolve to be ‘equal’. The idea of equality is inextricably intertwined with the idea of creation.</p>
            <p>A natural order is a stable order. There is no chance that gravity will cease to function tomorrow, even if people stop believing in it. In contrast, an imagined order is always in danger of collapse, because it depends upon myths, and myths vanish once people stop believing in them. In order to safeguard an imagined order, continuous and strenuous efforts are imperative. Some of these efforts take the shape of violence and coercion.</p>
            <p>To say that a social order is maintained by military force immediately raises the question: what maintains the military order? It is impossible to organise an army solely by coercion. At least some of the commanders and soldiers must truly believe in something, be it God, honour, motherland, manhood or money.</p>
            <p>To maintain an imagined order, we need people who believe in it - the military, the elites, and the peasants.</p>
            <p>Three main factors prevent people from realising that the order organising their lives exists only in their imagination:</p>
            <h4><strong>The imagined order is embedded in the material world.</strong></h4>
            <p>For example, houses have small rooms for every person living inside. This architecture promotes Individualism.</p>
            <h4><strong>The imagined order shapes our desires.</strong></h4>
            <p>Most people do not wish to accept that the order governing their lives is imaginary, but in fact every person is born into a pre-existing imagined order, and his or her desires are shaped from birth by its dominant myths. Our personal desires thereby become the imagined order’s most important defences.</p>
            <p>The elite of ancient Egypt spent their fortunes building pyramids and having their corpses mummified, but none of them thought of going shopping in Babylon or taking a skiing holiday in Phoenicia. People today spend a great deal of money on holidays abroad because they are true believers in the myths of romantic consumerism. Romanticism tells us that in order to make the most of our human potential we must have as many different experiences as we can.</p>
            <p>A wealthy man in ancient Egypt would never have dreamed of solving a relationship crisis by taking his wife on holiday to Babylon. Instead, he might have built for her the sumptuous tomb she had always wanted.</p>
            <p>Few question the myths that cause us to desire the pyramid in the first place.</p>
            <h4><strong>The imagined order is inter-subjective.</strong></h4>
            <p>Even if by some superhuman effort I succeed in freeing my personal desires from the grip of the imagined order, I am just one person. In order to change the imagined order I must convince millions of strangers to cooperate with me. For the imagined order is not a subjective order existing in my own imagination – it is rather an inter-subjective order, existing in the shared imagination of thousands and millions of people.</p>
            <p>The inter-subjective is something that exists within the communication network linking the subjective consciousness of many individuals. If a single individual changes his or her beliefs, or even dies, it is of little importance. However, if most individuals in the network die or change their beliefs, the inter-subjective phenomenon will mutate or disappear</p>
            <p>A change of such magnitude can be accomplished only with the help of a complex organisation, such as a political party, an ideological movement, or a religious cult. However, in order to establish such complex organisations, it’s necessary to convince many strangers to cooperate with one another. And this will happen only if these strangers believe in some shared myths. It follows that in order to change an existing imagined order, we must first believe in an alternative imagined order.</p>
            <h3>Preserving the imagined reality</h3>
            <p>After the imagined order, comes a means of facilitating and propagating the order.</p>
            <p>Between the years 3500 BC and 3000 BC, some unknown Sumerian geniuses invented a system for storing and processing information outside their brains, one that was custom-built to handle large amounts of mathematical data. The Sumerians thereby released their social order from the limitations of the human brain, opening the way for the appearance of cities, kingdoms and empires. The data-processing system invented by the Sumerians is called ‘writing’.</p>
            <p>Animals that engage strangers in ritualised aggression do so largely by instinct – puppies throughout the world have the rules for rough-and-tumble play hard-wired into their genes. But human teenagers have no genes for football. They can nevertheless play the game with complete strangers because they have all learned an identical set of ideas about football. These ideas are entirely imaginary, but if everyone shares them, we can all play the game.</p>
            <p>With greater numbers and growing imagined orders, we needed a system to organise the rules: No one person could remember all of them.</p>
            <p>Just imprinting a document in clay is not enough to guarantee efficient, accurate and convenient data processing. That requires methods of organisation like catalogues, methods of reproduction like photocopy machines, methods of rapid and accurate retrieval like computer algorithms, and pedantic librarians who know how to use these tools. Inventing such methods proved to be far more difficult than inventing writing.</p>
            <h3>More individual suffering</h3>
            <p>Understanding human history in the millennia following the Agricultural Revolution boils down to a single question: how did humans organise themselves in mass-cooperation networks, when they lacked the biological instincts necessary to sustain such networks? The short answer is that humans created imagined orders and devised scripts. These two inventions filled the gaps left by our biological inheritance.</p>
            <p>However, for many, this was a dubious blessing.</p>
            <p>With an order came social and political hierarchies.</p>
            <p>Throughout history, and in almost all societies, concepts of pollution and purity have played a leading role in enforcing social and political divisions and have been exploited by numerous ruling classes to maintain their privileges.</p>
            <p>If you want to keep any human group isolated – women, Jews, Roma, gays, blacks – the best way to do it is convince everyone that these people are a source of pollution.</p>
            <p>This led to a vicious circle of exploitation of people “lower” on the social ladder.</p>
            <p>These Social structures form depending on what hierarchy is visible or convenient.</p>
            <p>One example is the dark-skinned slaves.</p>
            <p>European conquerors of America chose to import slaves from Africa rather than from Europe or East Asia due to three circumstantial factors.</p>
            <p>Firstly, Africa was closer, so it was cheaper to import slaves from Senegal than from Vietnam.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in Africa there already existed a well-developed slave trade (exporting slaves mainly to the Middle East), whereas in Europe slavery was very rare. It was obviously far easier to buy slaves in an existing market than to create a new one from scratch</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and most importantly, American plantations in places such as Virginia, Haiti and Brazil were plagued by malaria and yellow fever, which had originated in Africa. Africans had acquired over the generations a partial genetic immunity to these diseases, whereas Europeans were totally defenseless and died in droves. It was consequently wiser for a plantation owner to invest his money in an African slave than in a European slave or indentured labourer</p>
            <p>Paradoxically, genetic superiority (in terms of immunity) translated into social inferiority.</p>
            <p>Different societies adopt different kinds of imagined hierarchies. Race is very important to modern Americans but was relatively insignificant to medieval Muslims. Caste was a matter of life and death in medieval India, whereas in modern Europe it is practically non-existent. One hierarchy, however, has been of supreme importance in all known human societies: the hierarchy of gender. People everywhere have divided themselves into men and women. And almost everywhere men have got the better deal, at least since the Agricultural Revolution.</p>
            <p>How can we distinguish what is biologically determined from what people merely try to justify through biological myths? A good rule of thumb is ‘Biology enables, Culture forbids.’ Biology is willing to tolerate a very wide spectrum of possibilities. It’s culture that obliges people to realise some possibilities while forbidding others. Biology enables women to have children – some cultures oblige women to realise this possibility. Biology enables men to enjoy sex with one another – some cultures forbid them to realise this possibility.</p>
            <p>Thus, the Agricultural Revolution led to much individual suffering. It led to more humans with a limited diet, higher risk of starvation, imagined realities to co-ordinate so many people, scripts to preserve that order, and social hierarchies to maintain that order. At the same time, it was an evolutionary success - much more people were alive at any given time.</p>

            </div></figure><p>All imagined orders created untill 1000 BC had a clear boundary. In united Egypt, everyone outside the country were barbarians. Our culture vs theirs. As Seth Godin puts it today, “People like us, do things like this.” - a microculture.</p>
            <p>The first millennium BC witnessed the appearance of three potentially universal orders, whose devotees could for the first time imagine the entire world and the entire human race as a single unit governed by a single set of laws. Everyone was ‘us’, at least potentially. There was no longer ‘them’.</p>
            <p>The first universal order to appear was economic: the monetary order.</p>
            <p>The second universal order was political: the imperial order.</p>
            <p>The third universal order was religious: the order of universal religions such as Buddhism, Christianity and Islam.</p>
            <h3>Money</h3>
            <p>The rise of cities and kingdoms and the improvement in transport infrastructure brought about new opportunities for specialisation. Densely populated cities provided full-time employment not just for professional shoemakers and doctors, but also for carpenters, priests, soldiers and lawyers.</p>
            <p>Everyone always wants money. This is perhaps its most basic quality. Everyone always wants money because everyone else also always wants money, which means you can exchange money for whatever you want or need.</p>
            <h4>How Money Works</h4>
            <p>Money is a psychological construct. It works by converting matter into mind. But why does it succeed? Why should anyone be willing to exchange a fertile rice paddy for a handful of useless cowry shells? Why are you willing to flip hamburgers, sell health insurance or babysit three obnoxious brats when all you get for your exertions is a few pieces of coloured paper?</p>
            <p>Its a system of mutual trust, and not just any system of mutual trust: money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.</p>
            <p>The first iteration of money were set weights made of pure silver. Everyone had to keep scales handy to measure them. Counterfeiting was easy. You couldn’t be sure it’s really pure silver.</p>
            <p>Coins helped solve these problems. The mark imprinted on them testifies to their exact value, so the shoemaker doesn’t have to keep a scale on his cash register. More importantly, the mark on the coin is the signature of some political authority that guarantees the coin’s value.</p>
            <p>With notes, we’ve extended the same basic concept. The Treasury guarantees the value of the notes, the number signifies its value.</p>
            <h4>Proliferation of gold</h4>
            <p>After silver, came gold. The Europeans believed in gold: They considered it to be very valuable. They wanted to trade gold with the world, and turns out, almost everyone else did, too.</p>
            <p>What would have happened to the global economy if the Chinese had refused to accept payment in gold and silver? Yet why should Chinese, Indians, Muslims and Spaniards – who belonged to very different cultures that failed to agree about much of anything – nevertheless share the belief in gold?</p>
            <p>Once trade is established, thanks to laws of supply and demand, the value of gold in India and the Mediterranean would be quite similar. The mere fact that Mediterranean people believed in gold would cause Indians to start believing in it as well.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>When everything is convertible, and when trust depends on anonymous coins and cowry shells, it corrodes local traditions, intimate relations and human values, replacing them with the cold laws of supply and demand.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h3>Empires</h3>
            <p>It is difficult to rule an empire in which every little district has its own set of laws, its own form of writing, its own language and its own money. Standardisation was a boon to emperors. Thus, empires spread a common culture.</p>
            <p>A second and equally important reason was to gain legitimacy within the districts. This led to the Imperial Cycle.</p>
            <h4>The Imperial Cycle</h4>
            <ul><li>A small group establishes a big empire.</li>
            <li>An imperial culture is forged.</li>
            <li>The imperial culture is adopted by the subjects people.</li>
            <li>The subject people demand equal status in the name of common imperial values.</li>
            <li>The empires founders lose their dominance.</li>
            <li>The imperial culture continues to flourish and develop.</li>
            </ul><p>The global empire being forged before our eyes is not governed by any particular state or ethnic group. Much like the Late Roman Empire, it is ruled by a multi-ethnic elite, and is held together by a common culture and common interests. Throughout the world, more and more entrepreneurs, engineers, experts, scholars, lawyers and managers are called to join the empire. They must ponder whether to answer the imperial call or to remain loyal to their state and their people. More and more choose the empire.</p>
            <p>This multi ethnic group of people come together to create a global empire – not via war, we are easily more sophisticated than that, but via economic and political powers.</p>
            <p>As the cycle goes, people start freely adopting the ideals of this global empire, then they demand to be equals. Then the rulers die off and the people continue the empire.</p>
            <h3>Religion</h3>
            <p>Today religion is often considered a source of discrimination, disagreement and disunion. Yet, in fact, religion has been the third great unifier of humankind, alongside money and empires.</p>
            <p>Since all social orders and hierarchies are imagined, they are all fragile, and the larger the society, the more fragile it is. The crucial historical role of religion has been to give superhuman legitimacy to these fragile structures. Religions assert that our laws are not the result of human caprice, but are ordained by an absolute and supreme authority. This helps place at least some fundamental laws beyond challenge, thereby ensuring social stability.</p>
            <p>Religion can thus be defined as a system of human norms and values that is founded on a belief in a superhuman order. This involves two distinct criteria:</p>
            <ol><li>
            <p>Religions hold that there is a superhuman order, which is not the product of human whims or agreements. Professional football is not a religion, because despite its many laws, rites and often bizarre rituals, everyone knows that human beings invented football themselves, and FIFA may at any moment enlarge the size of the goal or cancel the offside rule.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Based on this superhuman order, religion establishes norms and values that it considers binding. Many Westerners today believe in ghosts, fairies and reincarnation, but these beliefs are not a source of moral and behavioural standards. As such, they do not constitute a religion.</p>
            </li>
            </ol><p>In order to unite under its aegis a large expanse of territory inhabited by disparate groups of human beings, a religion must possess two further qualities. First, it must espouse a universal superhuman order that is true always and everywhere. Second, it must insist on spreading this belief to everyone. So, it must be universal and missionary.</p>
            <p>It’s interesting to watch the evolution of religion.</p>
            <details><summary>Expand: Evolution of Religion</summary><p>Earlier, Animism was the dominant belief system. Human norms and values had to take into consideration the outlook and interests of a multitude of other beings, such as animals, plants, fairies and ghosts.</p>
            <p>Local beliefs led to rules. Animals and plants were equal. Don’t cut down this fig tree lest the fig-tree spirit becomes angry. If the spirit stays happy, we’ll get lots of figs.</p>
            <p>But with agriculture, humans started rearing plants and animals. They couldn’t harm us anymore. We obtained control. They switched from mysteries to possessions.</p>
            <p>Much of ancient mythology is a legal contract in which humans promise everlasting devotion to the gods in exchange for mastery over plants and animals.</p>
            <p>The Agricultural Revolution initially had a far smaller impact on the status of other members of the animist system, such as rocks, springs, ghosts and demons. However, these too gradually lost status in favour of the new gods.</p>
            <p>As long as people lived their entire lives within limited territories of a few hundred square kilometers, most of their needs could be met by local spirits. But once kingdoms and trade networks expanded, people needed to contact entities whose power and authority encompassed a whole kingdom or an entire trade basin.</p>
            <p>The attempt to answer these needs led to the appearance of polytheistic religions (from the Greek: poly = many, theos = god).</p>
            <p>A terrible flood might wipe out billions of ants, grasshoppers, turtles, antelopes, giraffes and elephants, just because a few stupid Sapiens made the gods angry. Polytheism thereby exalted not only the status of the gods, but also that of humankind.</p>
            <p>The fundamental insight of polytheism, which distinguishes it from monotheism, is that the supreme power governing the world is devoid of interests and biases, and therefore it is unconcerned with the mundane desires, cares and worries of humans.</p>
            <p>Since polytheists believe, on the one hand, in one supreme and completely disinterested power, and on the other hand in many partial and biased powers, there is no difficulty for the devotees of one god to accept the existence and efficacy of other gods. Polytheism is inherently open-minded, and rarely persecutes ‘heretics’ and ‘infidels’.</p>
            <h4>Battle between good and evil for monotheism</h4>
            <p>Religion comes hand in hand with some fundamental concerns.</p>
            <p>Why is there evil in the world? Why is there suffering? Why do bad things happen to good people?</p>
            <p>Monotheists have to practice intellectual gymnastics to explain how an all-knowing, all-powerful and perfectly good God allows so much suffering in the world.</p>
            <p>Dualism (one good and one evil god) has its own drawbacks. While solving the Problem of Evil, it is unnerved by the Problem of Order. If the world was created by a single God, it’s clear why it is such an orderly place, where everything obeys the same laws. But if Good and Evil battle for control of the world, who enforces the laws governing this cosmic war?</p>
            <p>So, monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains evil, but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the riddle: to argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the entire universe – and He’s evil. But nobody in history has had the stomach for such a belief.</p>
            <h4>Towards principles other than god</h4>
            <p>Gautama found that there was a way to exit this vicious circle of craving, disappointment and wanting more. If, when the mind experiences something pleasant or unpleasant, it simply understands things as they are, then there is no suffering. If you experience sadness without craving that the sadness go away, you continue to feel sadness but you do not suffer from it. There can actually be richness in the sadness. If you experience joy without craving that the joy linger and intensify, you continue to feel joy without losing your peace of mind.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>A person who does not crave cannot suffer.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He encapsulated his teachings in a single law: suffering arises from craving; the only way to be fully liberated from suffering is to be fully liberated from craving; and the only way to be liberated from craving is to train the mind to experience reality as it is. This law, known as dharma or dhamma, is seen by Buddhists as a universal law of nature.</p>
            </details><p>  <br>
            The modern age has witnessed the rise of a number of new natural-law religions, such as liberalism, Communism, capitalism, nationalism and Nazism. These creeds do not like to be called religions, and refer to themselves as ideologies.</p>
            <p>Indeed, they are religions that worship humanity.</p>
            <h2>Scientific Revolution</h2>
            <figure><div class=\"RIL_IMG\" id=\"RIL_IMG_6\">
            <figure>
            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://pocket-image-cache.com//filters:no_upscale()/https%3A%2F%2Fneilkakkar.com%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fsapiens-timeline-5.jpg\">
            </figure>
            </div></figure><p>The typical premodern ruler gave money to priests, philosophers and poets in the hope that they would legitimise his rule and maintain the social order. He did not expect them to discover new medications, invent new weapons or stimulate economic growth.</p>
            <p>During the last five centuries, humans increasingly came to believe that they could increase their capabilities by investing in scientific research. This wasn’t just blind faith - it was proven empirically.</p>
            <p>This belief came in part because modern science differs from all previous traditions of knowledge in three critical ways:</p>
            <ol><li>
            <p><strong>The willingness to admit ignorance.</strong> Modern science is based on the Latin injunction ignoramus – ‘we do not know’. It assumes that we don’t know everything. Even more critically, it accepts that the things that we think we know could be proven wrong as we gain more knowledge. No concept, idea or theory is sacred and beyond challenge.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>The centrality of observation and mathematics.</strong> Having admitted ignorance, modern science aims to obtain new knowledge. It does so by gathering observations and then using mathematical tools to connect these observations into comprehensive theories.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>The acquisition of new powers.</strong> Modern science is not content with creating theories. It uses these theories in order to acquire new powers, and in particular to develop new technologies.</p>
            </li>
            </ol><p>It was inconceivable that the Bible, the Qur’an or the Vedas were missing out on a crucial secret of the universe – a secret that might yet be discovered by flesh-and-blood creatures.</p>
            <p>One of the things that has made it possible for modern social orders to hold together (after the move away from religions holding together social order) is the spread of an almost religious belief in technology and in the methods of scientific research, which have replaced to some extent the belief in absolute truths.</p>
            <p>Modern science has no dogma. Yet it has a common core of research methods, which are all based on collecting empirical observations – those we can observe with at least one of our senses – and putting them together with the help of mathematical tools.</p>
            <p>For men of science, death is not an inevitable destiny, but merely a technical problem. People die not because the gods decreed it, but due to various technical failures – a heart attack, cancer, an infection. And every technical problem has a technical solution.</p>
            <p>Further, most scientific studies are funded because somebody believes they can help attain some political, economic or religious goal.</p>
            <p>Thus, scientific research can flourish only in alliance with some religion or ideology. The ideology justifies the costs of the research. In exchange, the ideology influences the scientific agenda and determines what to do with the discoveries.</p>
            <p>Two forces in particular deserve our attention: imperialism and capitalism. The feedback loop between science, empire and capital has been history’s chief engine for the past 500 years.</p>
            <h3>Imperialism and science</h3>
            <p>The plant-seeking botanist and the colony-seeking naval officer shared a similar mindset. Both scientist and conqueror began by admitting ignorance – they both said, ‘I don’t know what’s out there.’ They both felt compelled to go out and make new discoveries. And they both hoped the new knowledge thus acquired would make them masters of the world.</p>
            <p>During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Europeans began to draw world maps with lots of empty spaces – one indication of the development of the scientific mindset, as well as of the European imperial drive. The empty maps were a psychological and ideological breakthrough, a clear admission that Europeans were ignorant of large parts of the world.</p>
            <p>The discovery of America was the foundational event of the Scientific Revolution. It not only taught Europeans to favour present observations over past traditions, but the desire to conquer America also obliged Europeans to search for new knowledge at breakneck speed. If they really wanted to control the vast new territories, they had to gather enormous amounts of new data about the geography, climate, flora, fauna, languages, cultures and history of the new continent. Christian Scriptures, old geography books and ancient oral traditions were of little help.</p>
            <h3>Capitalism and science</h3>
            <p>Scientific research is usually funded by either governments or private businesses. When capitalist governments and businesses consider investing in a particular scientific project, the first questions are usually, ‘Will this project enable us to increase production and profits? Will it produce economic growth?’ A project that can’t clear these hurdles has little chance of finding a sponsor. No history of modern science can leave capitalism out of the picture.</p>
            <p>However, the feedback loop between capitalism and science runs much deeper. Capitalism wouldn’t be possible without science, either. It’s based on a belief in the future - the future will be better than the present, thanks to science.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>A society of wolves would be extremely foolish to believe that the supply of sheep would keep on growing indefinitely.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>There’s much more to say about Capitalism. So much more, that I’ve separated it into a post of its own. Read here: <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/capitalism.html\">A Short History of Capitalism</a></p>
            <h2>Industrial Revolution</h2>
            <figure><div class=\"RIL_IMG\" id=\"RIL_IMG_7\">
            <figure>
            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://pocket-image-cache.com//filters:no_upscale()/https%3A%2F%2Fneilkakkar.com%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fsapiens-timeline-6.jpg\">
            </figure>
            </div></figure><p>The modern economy grows thanks to our trust in the future and to the willingness of capitalists to reinvest their profits in production. Yet that does not suffice. Economic growth also requires energy and raw materials, and these are finite. When and if they run out, the entire system will collapse.</p>
            <p>For millennia prior to the Industrial Revolution, humans already knew how to make use of a large variety of energy sources. They burned wood in order to smelt iron, heat houses and bake cakes. Sailing ships harnessed wind power to move around, and watermills captured the flow of rivers to grind grain. Yet all these had clear limits and problems. Trees were not available everywhere, the wind didn’t always blow when you needed it, and water power was only useful if you lived near a river.</p>
            <p>An even bigger problem was that people didn’t know how to convert one type of energy into another.</p>
            <p>Since human and animal bodies were the only energy conversion device available, muscle power was the key to almost all human activities. Everyone was fuelled by solar energy – captured and packaged in wheat, rice and potatoes.</p>
            <p>The invention of the steam engine brought about the Industrial Revolution.</p>
            <p>You burn some kind of fuel, such as coal, and use the resulting heat to boil water, producing steam. As the steam expands it pushes a piston. The piston moves, and anything that is connected to the piston moves with it. You have converted heat into movement.</p>
            <p>In the decades that followed, British entrepreneurs improved the efficiency of the steam engine, brought it out of the mineshafts, and connected it to looms and gins. This revolutionised textile production, making it possible to produce ever-larger quantities of cheap textiles.</p>
            <p>People became obsessed with the idea that machines and engines could be used to convert one type of energy into another. Any type of energy, anywhere in the world, might be harnessed to whatever need we had, if we could just invent the right machine.</p>
            <p>Another crucial discovery was the internal combustion engine, which took little more than a generation to revolutionise human transportation and turn petroleum into liquid political power. Petroleum had been known for thousands of years, and was used to waterproof roofs and lubricate axles. Yet until just a century ago nobody thought it was useful for much more than that. The idea of spilling blood for the sake of oil would have seemed ludicrous. You might fight a war over land, gold, pepper or slaves, but not oil.</p>
            <p>At heart, the Industrial Revolution has been a revolution in energy conversion. It has demonstrated again and again that there is no limit to the amount of energy at our disposal. Or, that the only limit is set by our ignorance. Every few decades we discover a new energy source, so that the sum total of energy at our disposal just keeps growing.</p>
            <p>The result of the industrial revolution was an explosion in human productivity. The explosion was felt first and foremost in agriculture. Usually, when we think of the Industrial Revolution, we think of an urban landscape of smoking chimneys, or the plight of exploited coal miners sweating in the bowels of the earth. Yet the Industrial Revolution was above all else the Second Agricultural Revolution.</p>
            <p>Without the industrialisation of agriculture the urban Industrial Revolution could never have taken place – there would not have been enough hands and brains to staff factories and offices.</p>
            <h3>Aftereffects of Industry</h3>
            <p>The Industrial Revolution turned the timetable and the assembly line into a template for almost all human activities. Shortly after factories imposed their time frames on human behaviour, schools too adopted precise timetables, followed by hospitals, government offices and grocery stores. Even in places devoid of assembly lines and machines, the timetable became king. If the shift at the factory ends at 5 p.m., the local pub had better be open for business by 5:02.</p>
            <p>This modest beginning spawned a global network of timetables, synchronised down to the tiniest fractions of a second. When the broadcast media – first radio, then television – made their debut, they entered a world of timetables and became its main enforcers and evangelists.</p>
            <p>Along with adapting to industrial time, this revolution brought about urbanisation, the disappearance of the peasantry, the rise of the industrial proletariat<sup><a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/sapiens.html#fn:1\">2</a></sup>, the empowerment of the common person, democratisation, youth culture and the disintegration of patriarchy.</p>
            <p>Most of the traditional functions of families and communities were handed over to states and markets.</p>
            <h4>Collapse of family</h4>
            <p>Village life involved many transactions but few payments. There were some markets, of course, but their roles were limited. You could buy rare spices, cloth and tools, and hire the services of lawyers and doctors. Yet less than 10 per cent of commonly used products and services were bought in the market. Most human needs were taken care of by the family and the community.</p>
            <p>Traditional agricultural economies had few surpluses with which to feed crowds of government officials, policemen, social workers, teachers and doctors. Consequently, most rulers did not develop mass welfare systems, health-care systems or educational systems.</p>
            <p>This was left for the family and communities.</p>
            <p>There wasn’t much a person renouncing his family could do. In order to survive, such a person had to find an alternative family or community. Boys and girls who ran away from home could expect, at best, to become servants in some new family. At worst, there was the army or the brothel.</p>
            <p>All this changed dramatically over the last two centuries. The Industrial Revolution gave the market immense new powers, provided the state with new means of communication and transportation, and placed at the government’s disposal an army of clerks, teachers, policemen and social workers. At first the market and the state discovered their path blocked by traditional families and communities who had little love for outside intervention. Parents and community elders were reluctant to let the younger generation be indoctrinated by nationalist education systems, conscripted into armies or turned into a rootless urban proletariat.</p>
            <p>The state and the market approached people with an offer that could not be refused. ‘Become individuals,’ they said. ‘Marry whomever you desire, without asking permission from your parents. Take up whatever job suits you, even if community elders frown. Live wherever you wish, even if you cannot make it every week to the family dinner. You are no longer dependent on your family or your community. We, the state and the market, will take care of you instead. We will provide food, shelter, education, health, welfare and employment. We will provide pensions, insurance and protection.’</p>
            <h4>Movement from war to peace</h4>
            <p>With industry and trade, countries moved from a plundering focused mindset to a protection focused mindset.</p>
            <p>Four factors led to peace.</p>
            <ol><li>Threat of nuclear holocaust.</li>
            <li>Declining profits of war with no new territories.</li>
            <li>Flourishing trade which increased cost of war.</li>
            <li>International connections between countries.</li>
            </ol><p>There is a positive feedback loop between all these four factors. The threat of nuclear holocaust fosters pacifism; when pacifism spreads, war recedes and trade flourishes; and trade increases both the profits of peace and the costs of war.</p>
            <p>Over time, this feedback loop creates another obstacle to war, which may ultimately prove the most important of all. The tightening web of international connections erodes the independence of most countries, lessening the chance that any one of them might single-handedly let slip the dogs of war. Most countries no longer engage in full-scale war for the simple reason that they are no longer independent.</p>

            </div></figure><p>The beauty of Darwin’s theory of Natural Selection is that it does not need to assume an intelligent designer to explain how giraffes ended up with long necks, or why lean and fast chicken survive.</p>
            <p>Biologists the world over are locked in battle with the intelligent-design movement, which opposes the teaching of Darwinian evolution in schools and claims that biological complexity proves there must be a creator who thought out all biological details in advance. The biologists are right about the past, but the proponents of intelligent design might, ironically, be right about the future.</p>
            <p>The first light for intelligent design appeared about 10,000 years ago, during the Agricultural Revolution. Sapiens who dreamed of fat, slow-moving chickens discovered that if they mated the fattest hen with the slowest cock, some of their offspring would be both fat and slow. If you mated those offspring with each other, you could produce a line of fat, slow birds. It was a race of chickens unknown to nature, produced by the intelligent design not of a god but of a human.</p>

            <p>History teaches us that what seems to be just around the corner may never materialise due to unforeseen barriers, and that other unimagined scenarios will in fact come to pass.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>What we should take seriously is the idea that the next stage of history will include not only technological and organisational transformations, but also fundamental transformations in human consciousness and identity.</p>

            </div><div><div><div><div><div><p><strong>“Don't worry about parking the car,”</strong> says the art thief. “Anywhere near the museum is fine.” When it comes to stealing from museums, Stéphane Breitwieser is virtually peerless. He is one of the most prolific and successful art thieves who have ever lived. Done right, his technique—daytime, no violence, performed like a magic trick, sometimes with guards in the room—never involves a dash to a getaway car. And done wrong, a parking spot is the least of his worries.</p><p>Just make sure to get there at lunchtime, Breitwieser stresses, when the visitors thin and the security staff rotates shorthanded to eat. Dress sharply, shoes to shirt, topped by a jacket that's tailored a little too roomy, with a Swiss Army knife stashed in a pocket.</p><p>Be friendly at the front desk. Buy your ticket, say hello. Once inside, Breitwieser adds, it's essential to focus. Note the flow of visitor traffic and memorize the exits. Count the guards. Are they sitting or patrolling? Check for security cameras and see if each has a wire—sometimes they're fake.</p><div></div><p>When it comes to museum flooring, creaky old wood is ideal, so even with his back turned, Breitwieser can hear footsteps two rooms away. Carpeting is the worst. Here, at the Rubens House, in Antwerp, Belgium, it's somewhere in between: marble. For this theft, Breitwieser has arrived with his girlfriend and frequent travel companion, Anne-Catherine Kleinklaus, who positions herself near the only doorway to a ground-floor exhibition room and coughs softly when anyone approaches.</p><div aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"presentation\"><div></div><div></div></div><div><span><picture><div class=\"RIL_IMG\" id=\"RIL_IMG_4\">

            </div></picture></span></div><p>The museum is the former home of Peter Paul Rubens, the great Flemish painter of the 1600s. Breitwieser isn't interested in stealing a Rubens; his paintings tend to be extremely large or too overtly religious for Breitwieser's taste. What sets Breitwieser apart from nearly every other art thief—it's the trait, he believes, that has facilitated his prowess—is that he will steal only pieces that stir him emotionally. And he insists that he never sells any. Stealing art for money, he says, is stupid. Money can be made with far less risk. But stealing for love, Breitwieser knows, is ecstatic.</p><div></div><p>And this piece, right in front of him, is a marvel. He had discovered it during a visit to the museum two weeks previous. He wasn't able to take it then, but its image blazed in his mind every time he sought sleep. This is why he's returned; this has happened before. There will be no good rest until the object is his.</p></div></div><div><div><p>It's an ivory sculpture of Adam and Eve, carved in 1627 by Georg Petel, a friend of Reubens's, who, according to Breitwieser, gifted him the piece for his 50th birthday. The carving is a masterpiece, just ten inches tall but dazzlingly detailed, the first humans gazing at each other as they move to embrace, Eve's hair scrolling down her back, the serpent coiled around the tree trunk behind them, and the unbitten apple, cheekily, in Adam's hand, indicating his complicity in the fall of man, contrary to the book of Genesis. “It's the most beautiful object I have ever seen,” says Breitwieser.</p><hr><div><figure><div><span><picture><div class=\"RIL_IMG\" id=\"RIL_IMG_5\">

            </div></picture></span></div></figure></div><p><strong>The ivory sculpture</strong> is sealed beneath a plexiglass dome fastened to a thick base, resting on an antique dresser. Breitwieser's first objective is to remove the two screws that connect the dome and the base. There's no camera here, and only one guard is in motion, poking her head in every few minutes.</p><p>The tourists, as usual, are the problem—too many of them, lingering. The room is filled with items Rubens had amassed during his lifetime, including marble busts of Roman philosophers, a terra-cotta sculpture of Hercules, and a scattering of 17th-century oil paintings.</p><p>Patience is needed, but a moment soon comes when it's just Kleinklaus and Breitwieser alone, and in an instant he unfolds the screwdriver from the Swiss Army knife and sets upon the plexiglass dome. Breitwieser is shorter than average and tousle-haired, with piercing blue eyes that, for all his stealth, are often animate with expression. He is lithe and coordinated, and uses athleticism and theater in his work. Maybe five seconds pass before Kleinklaus coughs and he vaults away from the carving, reverting to casual-art-gazing mode.</p><p>It's a start. He has turned the first screw twice around. Each job is different; improvisation is crucial—rigid plans do not work during daytime thefts, when there are variables too numerous to preordain. During his previous trip to the museum, he had studied how the Adam and Eve was protected and had also spotted a convenient door, reserved for guards, that opened into the central courtyard and did not appear to have an alarm.</p><p>Over the course of ten minutes, progressing fitfully, Breitwieser removes the first screw and pockets it. He does not wear gloves, trading fingerprints for dexterity. The second screw takes equally as long.</p><p>Now he's set. The security guard has already appeared three times, and at each check-in Breitwieser and Kleinklaus had stationed themselves in different spots. Still, the time elapsed in this room has reached his acceptable limit. There's a group of visitors present, all using audio guides and studying a painting, and Breitwieser judges them appropriately distracted.</p><div></div><p>He nods to his girlfriend, who slips out of the room, then lifts the plexiglass dome and sets it carefully aside. He grasps the ivory and pushes it into the waistband of his pants, at the small of his back, adjusting his roomy jacket so the carving is covered. There's a bit of a lump, but you'd have to be exceptionally observant to notice.</p><p>Then he strides off, moving with calculation but no obvious haste. He knows that the theft will swiftly be spotted. He'd left the plexiglass bell to the side—no need to waste precious seconds replacing it—and the guard will surely initiate an emergency response. Though not, he's betting, quickly enough.</p><p>From the room with the ivory, the museum layout encourages visitors to ascend to the second floor, but Breitwieser pushes through the door he'd seen on his earlier trip, crosses the courtyard toward the main entrance, and walks past the front desk onto the streets of Antwerp. Kleinklaus rejoins him before they reach the car, a little Opel Tigra, and Breitwieser sets the ivory in the trunk and they drive slowly away, pausing at traffic lights on the route out of town.</p><hr><div><figure><div><span><picture><div class=\"RIL_IMG\" id=\"RIL_IMG_6\">

They travel from Belgium to Luxembourg to Germany to their home in France without incident, just another young, stylish couple out for a jaunt. It's the first weekend of February 1997, and both are only 25 years old, though Breitwieser's already been stealing art for a while.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The road trip ends at a modest steep-roofed house built amid the sprawl of Mulhouse, an industrial city in eastern France. The ivory might be worth a million dollars, but Breitwieser is broke. He does not have a steady job—when he is employed, it's often as a waiter. His girlfriend works in a hospital as a nurse's aide, and the couple live in his mother's house. Their private space is on the top floor, an attic bedroom and small living area that Breitwieser always keeps locked.</p><p>They open the door now, cradling the ivory, and a wave of swirling colors seems to break over their heads as they step inside their fantasy world. The walls are lined with Renaissance paintings—portraits, landscapes, still lifes, allegories. There's a bustling peasant scene by Dutch master Adriaen van Ostade, an idyllic pastoral by French luminary François Boucher, an open-winged bat by German genius Albrecht Dürer. A resplendent 16th-century wedding portrait, the bride's dress threaded with pearls, by Lucas Cranach the Younger, may be worth more than all the houses on Breitwieser's block put together, times two.</p><p>In the center of the bedroom sits a grandiose canopied four-poster bed, draped with gold velour and red satin, surrounded by furniture stacked with riches. Silver goblets, silver platters, silver vases, silver bowls. A gold snuffbox once owned by Napoleon. A prayer book, lavishly illuminated, from the 1400s. Ornate battle weapons and rare musical instruments. Bronze miniatures and gilded teacups. Masterworks in enamel and marble and copper and brass. The hideaway shimmers with stolen treasure. “My Ali Baba's cave,” Breitwieser calls it.</p><p>Entering this place, every time, dizzies him with joy. He describes it as a sort of aesthetic rapture. Breitwieser sprawls on the bed, examining his new showpiece. The Adam and Eve ivory, after a four-century journey to arrive in his lair, appears more stunning than ever. It goes on the corner table, the first thing he sees when he opens his eyes.</p><div></div><p>During the week, while his girlfriend is working, he visits his local libraries. He learns everything he can about the ivory, the artist, his masters, his students. He takes detailed notes. He does this with nearly all his pieces—he gets attached to them. Back home, he meticulously cleans the carving, with soapy water and lemon, his thumb passing over the sculpture's every nubbin and ridge.</p><p>But this is not enough. His love for the ivory doesn't fade, that's not fair to say—he just has room in his heart for a little more love. So he consults his art magazines and auction catalogs. The Zurich art fair is about to begin. He plots a route into Switzerland, avoiding tolls to save money, and early the next Saturday morning they're back on the road.</p><hr><div><div><span><picture><div class=\"RIL_IMG\" id=\"RIL_IMG_7\">

            </div></picture></span></div></div><p><strong>All his life,</strong> inanimate objects have had the power to seduce him. “I get smitten,” Breitwieser says. Before artwork, it was stamps and coins and old postcards, which he'd purchased with pocket money. Later it was medieval pottery fragments he'd find near archaeological sites, free for the taking.</p><p>When he covets an object, says Breitwieser, he feels the emotional wallop of a <em>coup de coeur</em>—literally, a blow to the heart. There are just things that make him swoon. “Looking at something beautiful,” he explains, “I can't help but weep. There are people who do not understand this, but I can cry for objects.”</p><p>His interactions with the world of the living were far less fulfilling. He never really understood his peers, or almost anyone else for that matter. Popular pastimes, like sports and video games, baffled him. He's never had any interest in drinking or drugs. He could happily spend all day alone at a museum—his parents often dropped him off—or touring archaeological sites, of which there are dozens in the area where he grew up, but around others he was sometimes hotheaded and temperamental.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Breitwieser was born in 1971 in the Alsace region of northeastern France, where his family has deep roots. He speaks French and German and a little English. His father was a sales executive in Switzerland, just over the border, and his mother was a nurse. He's an only child. The family, for most of his youth, was well-off, living in a grand house filled with elegant furniture—Louis XV armchairs, from the 1700s; Empire dressers, from the 1800s. His parents had hoped he'd become a lawyer, but he dropped out of university after a couple of years.</p><div><span><picture><div class=\"RIL_IMG\" id=\"RIL_IMG_9\">

            </div></picture></span></div><p>His first museum heist came shortly after a family crisis. When he was 22 years old, still living at home, his parents' marriage ended explosively. His father left and took his possessions with him, and Breitwieser and his mother tumbled down the social ladder, re-settling in a smaller place, the antiques replaced by Ikea.</p><p>Cushioning the trauma was a woman Breitwieser met through an acquaintance, a fellow archeology buff. Anne-Catherine Kleinklaus was the same age as Breitwieser, and similarly introverted, with a kindred sense of curiosity and adventure. She had a sly smile and an irresistible pixie cut. They shared a passion for museums, thrilled to be immersed in beauty. Breitwieser finally experienced a <em>coup de coeur</em> for an actual person. “I loved her right away,” he says. Soon after Breitwieser's father departed, Kleinklaus moved in.</p><div></div><p>A few months later, the couple were visiting a museum in the French village of Thann when Breitwieser spotted an antique pistol. His first thought, he recalls, was that he should already own something like this. Breitwieser's father had collected old weapons but had taken them when he'd left the family, not bothering to leave a single piece for his son. The firearm, exhibited in a glass case on the museum's second floor, was hand-carved around 1730. It was far nicer than anything his father had owned.</p><p>He felt an urge to possess it. The museum was small, no security guard or alarm system, just a volunteer at the entrance booth. The display case itself, Breitwieser noted, was partially open. He was wearing a backpack and could easily hide the pistol in there.</p><p>One must resist temptation, he knew. It even says so in the Bible, not that he was particularly religious. What our heart really wants, we must often deny. Maybe this is why so many people seem conflicted and miserable—we are taught to be at constant war with ourselves. As if that were a virtue.</p></div></div><div><div><p>What would happen, he wondered, if he did not resist temptation? If, instead, he fed temptation and freed himself from society's repressive restraints? He had no desire to physically harm anyone or so much as cause fright. He contemplated the flintlock pistol and whispered a few of these thoughts to his girlfriend.</p><p>Anne-Catherine Kleinklaus has never spoken to the media about her relationship with Breitwieser and any possible role in the crimes, and neither has Breitwieser's mother, Mireille Stengel. Though there exist supporting documents and reported accounts, much of this story is based primarily on interviews with Breitwieser. While he was in the museum, in front of the pistol, Kleinklaus's response, the way Breitwieser remembers it, made him believe that they were destined to be together.</p><p>“Go ahead,” she said. “Take it.” So he did.</p><hr><p><strong>From that moment on,</strong> he catered to his impulses in an unimaginable way. His only goal was to obey temptation. By the time he pilfers the Adam and Eve ivory, three years after stealing the pistol, he's amassed some 100 objects, all on display in his hideout. He is ecstatic beyond measure, cosseted like a king. He feels as though he and his girlfriend have discovered the meaning of life.</p><p>A curious thing about temptation, at least in Breitwieser's case, is that it never seems to abate. If anything, the more he feeds it, the hungrier it gets. The weekend after the ivory theft in Belgium, Breitwieser and Kleinklaus drive through the snow-streaked Alps to the Zurich art fair. Behind a dealer's back, quick as a cat, he steals a spectacular goblet, filigreed with silver and gold, from the 16th century.</p><div></div><p>Then they head to Holland for another fair, and at one booth, while the vendor is eating lunch and not keeping careful watch, Breitwieser takes a brilliant rendering of a lake bobbing with swans, dated 1620. At another booth, again with the dealer present, he removes a 17th-century seascape painted on copper.</p><p>A few weeks later, it's back to Belgium, to a village museum with a single security guard, where he takes a valuable still life, butterflies flitting around a bouquet of tulips, by Flemish master Jan van Kessel the Elder. This is followed by a trip to a Paris auction, where, at the pre-sale show, he steals a painting from the school of Pieter Brueghel the Elder and Pieter Brueghel the Younger, two polestars of Renaissance art.</p><p>Once again he returns to Belgium—a country whose museums, says Breitwieser, “attract me like a lover”—and filches a vivid tableau of a rural market, then over to Holland to snatch a droll 17th-century watercolor of house cats chasing hedgehogs, followed by a journey to the northern French city of Lille for another Renaissance oil work, and finally, for good measure, one more raid in Belgium.</p><p>All of this in a matter of months. These paintings alone represent a haul worth millions of dollars. And it's not just paintings—he also steals a gold-plated hourglass, a stained-glass windowpane, an iron alms box, a copper collection plate, a brass hunting bugle, a cavalry saber, a couple of daggers, a gilded ostrich egg, a wooden altarpiece, and a half-dozen pocket watches. Everything is crammed into the hideout, filling the walls top to bottom, overflowing the end tables, displayed in his closet's shoe rack, leaning on chairs, stuffed under the bed.</p><p>The collection is not random. Virtually everything he steals was made before the Industrial Revolution, in an age when items were all still formed by hand; no machines stamped out parts. Everything finely crafted in this way, Breitwieser believes, from medical instruments to kitchenware, is its own little work of art, the hand of the master visible in each chisel mark and burr. This, to Breitwieser, was the height of human civilization.</p><p>Today the world is wed to mass production and efficiency, much to our benefit. But a side effect is that beauty for beauty's sake seems increasingly quaint, and museums themselves, small ones especially, can have the whiff of the dying. Stocking pieces in his room, Breitwieser feels, is rescuing them, like pets from a shelter, giving them the love and attention they deserve.</p></div></div><div><div><hr><p><strong>The more he steals,</strong> the better he gets. He learns, with precision, the limits of a security camera's vision. He hones his timing and perfects his composure. “You have to control your gestures, your words, your reflexes,” Breitwieser says. “You need a predatory instinct.” He pounces the instant he senses everyone's attention is diverted. “The pleasure of having,” says Breitwieser, “is stronger than the fear of stealing.”</p><p>He tries to take only smaller pieces—with paintings, no more than about a foot by a foot—and if time allows, he prefers to remove the frame and hide it nearby, often in a bathroom, so the artwork disappears more completely beneath his jacket. He purchases new frames for most of the works. Sometimes he steals weapons, but he wouldn't think of brandishing one. To walk into a museum with a gun, he says, is disgusting.</p><div></div><p>The set of thefts he describes as the most exquisite of his career are a study in simplicity and sangfroid. They take place in Belgium, his beloved target, at the vast Art &amp; History Museum in Brussels, which Breitwieser estimates employs 150 guards. There he and Kleinklaus spot a partly empty display case, with a laminated card inside that reads \"Objects removed for study.\" Nothing in the case interests them, but Breitwieser has an idea and steals the card.</p><div><span><picture><div class=\"RIL_IMG\" id=\"RIL_IMG_10\">

            </div></picture></span></div><p>Breitwieser understands how security guards think. At age 19, he was employed for a month as a guard at the Historical Museum of Mulhouse, near his home. Most guards, he realized, hardly notice the art on the walls—they look only at people. Breitwieser's brashest thefts, like the Adam and Eve ivory, are spotted in minutes, but when he's furtive, hours often pass, and sometimes days, before anyone realizes what's happened.</p><p>In the Brussels Art &amp; History Museum, he carries the \"Objects removed\" sign to a gallery with a display case of silver pieces from the 16th century. To break into this case, Breitwieser uses a screwdriver and levers the sliding door off its tracks. Other times, he carries a box cutter and slices open a silicone joint. For museums with antique display cabinets, he brings a ring of a dozen old skeleton keys he's amassed—often one of his keys is able to tumble the lock. Also handy is a telescoping antenna, to nudge a ceiling-mounted security camera in a different direction.</p><p>He selects three silver items, a drinking stein and two figurines; then he sets the \"Objects removed\" card in the case and re-attaches the sliding door, and they leave the museum. They're already at the car before he realizes he's forgotten the lid to the stein.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Breitwieser detests missing parts or any sign of restoration. The items in his collection must be original and complete. Kleinklaus knows this, says Breitwieser, and she abruptly removes one of her earrings and heads back to the museum, her boyfriend in tow. She marches up to a security guard and says she's lost an earring and has a feeling she knows where it is. The couple are permitted back inside. They return to the case and he takes the stein's lid and, why not, two additional goblets from another case.</p><p>Two weeks later, they're back. Kleinklaus has changed her hairstyle, and Breitwieser has grown out his beard and added a pair of glasses and a baseball cap. At the display case, the \"Objects removed\" card still there, he grabs four more items, including a two-foot-tall chalice so breathtakingly gorgeous that Breitwieser suspends his size-limitation preference and, with nowhere else to put it, stuffs the item up the left sleeve of his jacket, forcing him to walk unnaturally, his arm swinging stiffly like a soldier's.</p><p>On their way to the exit, they're stopped by a guard. They feign calm, but Breitwieser has a terrible feeling that the end has come. The guard wants to see their entrance tickets. Breitwieser, unable to move his left arm, awkwardly reaches across his body with his right to fish the tickets from his left pocket. He wonders if the guard senses something amiss.</p><p>A guilty person would cower and try to leave, so Breitwieser boldly tells the guard that he's heading to the museum café for lunch. The guard's suspicion is defused, and the couple actually eat at the museum, Breitwieser's arm held rigid the entire time.</p><div></div><p>They rent a cheap hotel room and wait two days and return yet again, newly disguised, and he steals four more pieces. That's a total of 13, and such is their level of euphoria that on the drive home they can't contain themselves and stop at an antiques gallery displaying an immense ancient urn, made of silver and gold, in the front window.</p><p>Breitwieser enters, and the dealer calls from atop a staircase that he'll be right down, but by the time he descends no one is there. Nor is the urn. They return to France plunder-drunk and giddy, and for fun, Breitwieser recalls, Kleinklaus phones the gallery and asks how much the urn in the window costs. About $100,000, she's told. “Madame,” says the dealer, “you really must see it.” He hasn't yet noticed it's gone.</p><hr><p><strong>Of course the police are after them.</strong> Investigations are opened after many of their thefts—witnesses questioned, sketches made. Yet no one's ever quite sure what they saw. Breitwieser is videoed in action in a museum in France, but the images are grainy. The best the French authorities are able to deduce is that several times a year, in seemingly random places, a man and a woman steal art together; they envision the criminals as a retired couple, nowhere close to their actual age.</p><p>The couple themselves keep tabs on their peril by reading newspaper coverage of their crimes. Some articles mention that law enforcement is sure that a large network of international traffickers are systematically stealing. The authorities, much to Breitwieser's satisfaction, seem to have no clue as to whom they are chasing—the sheer scale of the thefts is so far beyond that of nearly every other case as to be practically inconceivable.</p><p>In the annals of art crime, it's hard to find someone who has stolen from ten different places. By the time the calendar flips to 2000, by Breitwieser's calculations, he's nearing 200 separate thefts and 300 stolen objects. For six years, he's averaged one theft every two weeks. One year, he is responsible for half of all paintings stolen from French museums.</p><p>By some combination of skill and luck, Breitwieser and Kleinklaus are doing everything right to avoid capture. They constantly shift the countries they target, alternating between rural and urban locations, large museums and small, while further mixing things up by stealing from churches, auction houses, and art fairs. They don't kick down doors or cover their faces with masks—actions that would trigger a much greater police response. Crime works best, Breitwieser believes, when no one realizes it's being committed.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Several times, he steals while they're on a guided tour, then casually continues the tour while holding the item. At an art fair in Holland, Breitwieser hears a shout of “Thief!” and sees security guards tackle a man. It's another burglar. Breitwieser takes advantage of the commotion and slips a painting under his coat.</p><hr><p><strong>There are, inevitably, several close calls.</strong> Once, Breitwieser accidentally shatters a glass display case. Another time, he returns to his car while holding sections of a 16th-century wooden altarpiece only to encounter a police officer in the process of giving him a parking ticket. While hiding the artwork beneath his jacket, he manages to persuade the officer to withdraw the ticket. Soon after a theft in France, roadblocks are set up on some of the routes leading from the museum, but Breitwieser and Kleinklaus manage to avoid being stopped.</p><div></div><p>Then they visit an art gallery in Lucerne, Switzerland. It's a hot day, and Breitwieser is not wearing a jacket that he can use to hide a stolen object—and even worse, they are the gallery's only visitors. The place is also directly across the street from a police station. Kleinklaus, according to Breitwieser, issues a warning. “Don't do anything,” she says. “I don't feel it, I'm telling you.”</p><p>But Breitwieser has spotted a 17th-century still life by Dutch painter Willem van Aelst that is simply too tempting. And it seems so easy to take. He puts the painting under his arm and walks out as casually as if he's carrying a baguette. A gallery employee instantly spots the theft, accosts the couple outside the gallery, and escorts them across the street to the police. Breitwieser and Kleinklaus remain in custody overnight but manage to convince the authorities that this is the first time they'd ever stolen and that they are terribly, deeply sorry. They are released with hardly any punishment.</p><p>Rattled, the couple make a vow never to steal in Switzerland again and decide to take a break from thieving entirely. The respite lasts all of three weeks before Breitwieser, at an auction in Paris, steals a scene of a grape harvest by Flemish painter David Vinckboons. After that, he returns to stealing as frequently as before.</p><p>An art thief Breitwieser admires, he says, is Thomas Crown, from the two <em>Thomas Crown Affair</em> movies. But that's fiction. Breitwieser is furious at nearly all actual art thieves, especially people like those who broke into Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 1990. The two thieves took 13 works worth a total of $500 million, but they used knives to slice some of the paintings from their frames. Breitwieser would never consider cutting out a painting—that, he says, is vandalism. He wouldn't even roll up a canvas, an action that risks cracking the paint. “You roll up an old painting,” he says, “and you kill it.”</p><p>About 50,000 artworks are stolen each year around the world, and according to the director of the London-based Art Loss Register, the most comprehensive database of stolen art, more than 99 percent of art thieves are motivated by profit rather than aesthetics. This is why art crimes are typically solved on the back end, when the thieves try to sell the work. But with Breitwieser, law enforcement's chief strategy—poring over art-market data, waiting for the stolen items to reappear—is dead on arrival.</p><p>Still, a multi-million-dollar collection of stolen art concealed in an attic bedroom in a middle-class suburb seems too extraordinary to remain secret forever. If just one friend found out, it's inevitable others would learn and the game would be finished.</p><p>Breitwieser and Kleinklaus, though, have no friends. “I've always been a loner,” he says. “I don't want any friends.” Kleinklaus, he claims, feels the same. They occasionally spend time with acquaintances but never invite anyone over. If repairs are needed in his room, he does them himself. Nobody is allowed to enter, ever, except him and his girlfriend. “We lived in a closed universe,” Breitwieser says.</p></div></div><div><div><hr><p><strong>They're both nearing 30 years old</strong> when their universe starts to crumble. A notion had been building in Kleinklaus ever since the night they spent in police custody in Switzerland—that perhaps there's something more fulfilling than life as an outlaw and rooms filled with riches. She'd like to start a family. But not, she realizes, with the man she's been dating for almost a decade. There is no option for a child in their conscribed existence. They could be arrested at any minute; they can't even entertain visitors. She begins to feel suffocated.</p><div></div><p>Breitwieser, meanwhile, says he feels “invincible.” Tension between the two intensifies, ugly fights erupt, and Breitwieser starts stealing alone. Any restraining influences Kleinklaus once provided are shed. From a village church not far from their house, he unbolts an enormous wooden carving of the Madonna and Child, weighing 150 pounds, and hauls it away, one strained step at a time, without the slightest attempt at stealth. If anyone had entered the church during the theft, he'd have been caught.</p><p>Later, in February 2001, at a hilltop castle, he removes a monumental 17th-century tapestry, larger than ten feet by ten feet, assuming ridiculous risk to steal it. There's no room in their lair for a trophy this size—it's left rolled up on a dresser—but Breitwieser tells his girlfriend they'll display it as soon as they are free of his mother and residing in a place of their own. By this point, Kleinklaus knows it's a fantasy. Living amid a mountain of stolen art, no matter where, can never offer true freedom at all.</p><p>After the police had taken their fingerprints in Switzerland, Breitwieser says, Kleinklaus fears that the prints are now filed in every nation's database. Even if she leaves him, she'll be hunted forever. What will they ever do with all this stuff? What's the endgame? She wants him to quit, but he doesn't even agree to abate. The best deal she can wrangle is a sworn promise that from now on, when stealing, he'll always wear surgical gloves, which she'll bring home from her job at the hospital. There is no endgame, Breitwieser says. He plans to keep going and going.</p><hr><div><span><picture><div class=\"RIL_IMG\" id=\"RIL_IMG_11\">

It was a stylish theft, Breitwieser balancing atop a radiator to cut open a display case high on the wall, then delicately snipping the nylon cords holding the bugle in place. Kleinklaus is unimpressed. They already have one like it.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“Did you wear gloves?” she asks, suspicious.</p><p>“I'm really sorry,” he says.</p><p>The one thing she'd been promised. Then she learns that he'd stolen the bugle in Switzerland, the one country where they'd vowed never to steal from again. He had even gone to a museum near Lucerne—the same city in which they'd been caught. They argue bitterly, and in the morning Breitwieser says he'll go back to Switzerland and erase the prints.</p><p>Breitwieser says that this idea doesn't work for Kleinklaus; she wants to go to the museum and clean the prints herself. It's too risky for him. Breitwieser says that at least he should drive, and she consents.</p><div></div><p>They're frosty to each other on the trip, but as they pull into the Richard Wagner Museum, housed in a country manor where the composer once lived, their spirits are buoyed. The one thing that can stir Breitwieser as much a magnificent artwork is a sublime sweep of nature, and this museum is on a lake cupped in the spiked mountains of Switzerland. He feels for a moment, as Kleinklaus opens her door, a handkerchief and a bottle of rubbing alcohol in her bag, that maybe they can again find their love.</p><p>“Stay in the car,” she pleads.</p><p>“I'm just going to take a little walk,” he says. “Don't worry.” And he, too, gets out, handing her the car keys to hold in her purse.</p><p>She enters the museum, pays the entry fee, and walks up to the second floor. Breitwieser, circling around the outside of the building, watches her progress as she appears in one window, then another. There's only one other person around, an older man walking a dog, who seems to stare curiously at Breitwieser before moving away.</p><p>A few minutes later, Kleinklaus exits the museum. She walks quickly toward him, nearly jogging, which is odd. They never wanted to appear as if they were fleeing. He has the impression that she's attempting to tell him something, but she is too far away to hear. He tries to decipher the anxious expression on her face as the police car pulls to a stop behind him. Two officers approach, handcuff Breitwieser, who is startled but doesn't resist, and place him in the back seat of the squad car and drive off.</p><hr><div><span><picture><div class=\"RIL_IMG\" id=\"RIL_IMG_12\">

            </div></picture></span></div><p><strong>He spends that night,</strong> November 20, 2001, in jail, and the next morning the interrogation begins. At the start of the questioning, says Breitwieser, he denied everything. After all, he didn't have any stolen items on him when he was arrested. But both the cashier at the museum and the dog walker who'd been on the grounds, says Breitwieser, have provided formal statements to the police.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The dog walker, a retired journalist, had read in that morning's paper about the Richard Wagner Museum theft, and when he saw a man there acting oddly, he went inside and mentioned it to the cashier. She looked out the window. The day the bugle was stolen, a total of three visitors had come to the museum, and this, she was certain, was one of them. He was wearing the same jacket. So she called the police. No one realized that Kleinklaus, who had overheard the conversation and was trying to warn him, had traveled with Breitwieser, and she was able to drive off in her car unnoticed.</p><p>Breitwieser realizes that to wriggle free from this jam, he needs to ensure that the authorities do not find out who he really is or send anyone to search his home. He tells the police that he'd come to Switzerland by train, alone, and admits to stealing the bugle. He explains, sorrowfully, that he is short of money and just wanted a nice Christmas gift for his mother. He has no idea, he adds, that the bugle is valuable; he was only attracted to it because of how shiny it was.</p><p>In the course of his conversation with the officers, he learns that the police never even considered dusting for prints.</p><div></div><p>Days drip by, then weeks, as he waits alone in his cell, worry mounting. He's not permitted to make phone calls, and he has the impression, he says, that the entire world has abandoned him. No one will give him any news.</p><p>What's happened is that the police have uncovered the report of Breitwieser's previous brush with the law in Switzerland. This was very intriguing. They'd at first assumed that Breitwieser was nothing more than a small-time thief who'd hoped to make an easy profit from a lightly guarded museum. Could he be something more?</p><p>Swiss authorities pursue an international search warrant for Breitwieser's residence in France. It takes a while to complete the warrant, but four weeks after his arrest, it's ready. A group of French and Swiss officers arrive at the house, hoping to find the bugle, and perhaps more. Breitwieser's mother is there and says she has no idea what they're talking about.</p><p>The officers enter the house, climb the stairs to the hidden lair, and open the door. And there, inside, they see no hunting bugle, no silver objects, no Renaissance paintings, no musical instruments. Not so much as the trace of a picture hook. Nothing but clean, empty walls surrounding a lovely four-poster bed.</p><hr><p><strong>Breitwieser remains in jail, knowing nothing.</strong> No one visits or writes. Christmas comes and goes without even a holiday card. He feels sick; he cries frequently. He has admitted to only the theft of the bugle, but he knows that he's close to breaking.</p><p>Soon after New Year's Day 2002, he is escorted from his cell and seated in an interrogation room, across the desk from a Swiss police lieutenant named Roland Meier. The officer opens a drawer, removes a single photo, and places it in front of Breitwieser. It's of a large commemorative medal that he had stolen from a different Swiss museum, a week before he'd taken the bugle. Breitwieser had imagined it could serve as a good-luck charm. The medal appears a little rusty and worn, and Breitwieser wonders what happened to it.</p><p>“We know you also stole this,” says Lieutenant Meier. “Tell us, and after that everything will be okay. We'll let you go home.”</p><p>Breitwieser swiftly confesses.</p><div></div><p>Just one more thing, says Lieutenant Meier, opening the drawer again and placing another photo before Breitwieser. This one is of a golden snuffbox, also slightly oxidized.</p><p>Breitwieser confesses to taking it as well.</p><p>And then, according to Breitwieser's version of these events, the officer pulls out a huge stack of photos, and Breitwieser realizes it's checkmate. There are pictures of an ivory flute from Denmark, an enameled goblet from Germany, silver pieces from Belgium, and even the very first item he stole, nearly eight years before—the flint-lock pistol from France.</p></div></div><div><div><p>He confesses to every one of them, providing details and dates. When the stack of photos is exhausted, he's admitted to stealing 140 objects. The lieutenant is staggered—he'd doubted this kid had stolen a single one of the items, let alone all of them.</p><p>Only now does Breitwieser see the police report that accompanied the photos. At the top it says “Objects found in the Rhone-Rhine Canal.” He's confused. The canal, part of the system built under Napoleon to connect the rivers of France, is a murky, slow-moving waterway not far from his home.</p><p>Then he realizes why the pieces seemed discolored—they must have been rescued from water. One more thing dawns on him as well. There were no photos of any paintings he stole. “What about the paintings?” he asks the lieutenant. And it's only then that he starts to find out.</p><hr><div><span><picture><div class=\"RIL_IMG\" id=\"RIL_IMG_13\">

            </div></picture></span></div><p><strong>What happened exactly</strong> remains a mystery. And because Breitwieser's mother and girlfriend have never talked to the media, the details may never be fully revealed. Breitwieser himself, though, has learned as much as he can, and combining his insights with police investigations and interviews, it's possible for him to piece together the events as he believes they may have occurred. Some specifics are lacking, and the precise time line is hazy, but not the result. The end, Breitwieser says, is always the same.</p><p>He envisions his girlfriend driving back from Switzerland, alone in the car, terrified. She's just witnessed his arrest and has not been caught herself. At least not yet. When she gets home, Breitwieser suspects, she tells his mother at least some part of the truth about the extent of the crimes. The fact that Breitwieser is in custody means the authorities will surely soon arrive and probably arrest both of them as well.</p><p>It's now, Breitwieser presumes, that his girlfriend takes his mother upstairs to their hideout. When Breitwieser visualizes his treasures through his mother's eyes, they look different. She's not spellbound by color or entranced by beauty. His mother works full-time to house and feed her 30-year-old unemployed son and his girlfriend, and he's repaid her by breaking the law in a way that will likely ruin her life.</p><div></div><p>To her, his treasure is poison. She's always had a temper, and his mother's reaction, he's sure, is a boiling rage. Once she decides something, there's no bending her will. “She's like a wall,” Breitwieser says. And she makes a decision now, one of finality and force.</p><p>It likely began that evening. First, Breitwieser thinks, his mother and possibly his girlfriend clear off the furniture, empty the closet, and collect everything under the bed. It's all piled in bags and boxes, then carried downstairs and crammed into his mother's car until the vehicle is completely full.</p><p>It must be very late, Breitwieser believes, when they drive to the canal. They go to a spot where the waterway runs plumb straight through a quiet, rural area, bordered on both sides by sheltering trees, the trail alongside it often busy by day with cyclists and joggers. The two women, Breitwieser thinks, then toss piece after piece into the dark water. Even in these panicked, angry actions, Breitwieser sees a filament of love—his mother, in some way, is trying to protect him, to hide what he's done.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Some pieces aren't thrown far enough from shore, and a few days later a passerby notices an intriguing shimmer in the water. He returns with a rake and finds a gold-plated chalice. Then he rakes out three more pieces of silver and a jewel-handled dagger. He tells the police, and they eventually drain a section of the canal and discover a collection of objects likely worth millions.</p><p>Back at Breitwieser's house, probably the same night as the canal dump, his mother and perhaps his girlfriend again load the car, possibly this time with the bigger items, including the heavy Madonna and Child, the tapestry, and three paintings on copper panels. The Madonna and Child is deposited in front of a local church—his mother is observant—while the tapestry is discarded aside a road and the coppers are tossed into a wooded area.</p><p>All these items are eventually recovered. A passing motorist spots the tapestry and turns it in to the local police, who are not aware of its significance and unfurl it on the floor of their break room and play billiards on it for a while. The three 17th-century coppers are found by a logger, who brings them home and hammers them onto the roof of his henhouse, which had been leaking. They remain there until Breitwieser's story hits the news.</p><p>The paintings, Breitwieser believes, were the final step. His Renaissance paintings formed the heart of his collection and represented the majority of its value. Breitwieser is sure that as the pictures are pulled from the walls, Kleinklaus is in shock—all he'd wanted to do was protect them from an uncaring planet—but his mother, he knows, is unstoppable. Later his mother will purchase putty and wall paint to cover the holes, and she will also throw away everything else in the rooms, including his clothing and books. But for now his mother drives all the paintings to a secluded area.</p><p>She creates a big pile, Breitwieser imagines, the portraits and still lifes and landscapes all jumbled, the luminaries of Renaissance art—Cranach, Brueghel, Teniers, Dürer, van Kessel, Dou—gathered as one. Every piece has survived some 300 years, through Europe's bloody centuries, carrying its singular image to the world. Sixty-six paintings in total. In a haphazard heap.</p><div></div><p>A lighter is sparked and the flames rise, slowly at first and then wildly, oil paint bubbling, picture frames crackling, the great mass burning and burning until there's almost nothing left but ash.</p><hr><p><strong>After that, what does anything matter?</strong></p><p>Breitwieser is so shattered that he's medicated and placed on suicide watch in the jail. Later he's just numb. He is charged with theft and goes to trial twice, in Switzerland and in France, and serves a total of four years in prison, the punishment modest because no one has been physically injured, and the value of his loot, which some sources placed at over a billion dollars, didn't affect the penalty—in the eyes of the law, there's little difference between mass-produced baubles and Renaissance masterworks.</p><p>In prison he meets with several psychologists. He's described in reports as an “arrogant” and “hypersensitive” man who believes he is “indispensable to humankind” but is never given a diagnosis and is not considered mentally ill at his trials. Because he specifically selected his loot, rather than randomly grabbing, and never displayed guilt about his actions, he doesn't fit the criteria for being a kleptomaniac.</p><p>Breitwieser's mother goes to trial for her role in destroying the works and is found guilty. She spends just a few months in jail. In court it was stated that she thought it was “just a bunch of junk” and that until her son's arrest, she had no clue he'd been stealing. Breitwieser supports these claims, testifying that his mother is unfamiliar with the art world and that he told her he'd picked up trinkets at flea markets. Even though he'd shared a house with her, he'd made sure, he adds, to keep his mother mostly shut out of his life and completely shut out of his room.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Anne-Catherine Kleinklaus spends just a single night in jail. The story she tells the court strains credulity. She had no idea, she says, that her boyfriend was a thief. “I never played the role of the lookout,” she adds. “There were paintings and objects in his room, but nothing struck me as unusual.” Breitwieser, testifying at the trial, doesn't contradict her, gallantly trying to protect her. If he can spare her some punishment, he will.</p><p>He believes his gesture may have worked, at least for her. She is never charged with destroying the art or convicted for direct involvement in the thefts, only for handling and knowledge of the stolen goods. Breitwieser realizes he's still in love and writes her repeatedly from jail. She's his last hope that something worthwhile will remain in his life. But there's never a reply to his letters, and eventually he finds out why. Shortly after his arrest, Kleinklaus had started another relationship, and soon thereafter she was pregnant. By the time Breitwieser learns this, she's the mother of a baby, and he vows never to see her again.</p><hr><p><strong>He's released from prison in 2005,</strong> and at the age of 33 he feels defeated. He had lived a hundred lifetimes while stealing, and now everything is colorless and dumb. He cuts trees for a while, he drives a delivery truck, he mops floors. The relationship with his mother is mended, though he rents a cheap apartment of his own.</p><div></div><p>As a result of his crimes, he says, he's not permitted to enter a museum or any other place showing art. He muddles away a couple of years, the bare walls of his apartment a kind of slow-drip torture, until, as it must with a mania like his, the deep-seated desire breaks through.</p><p>He goes to Belgium, and at an antiques fair, he sees a landscape that slays him—three people strolling through a wintry forest, by one of his favorites, Pieter Brueghel the Younger. He doesn't even try to stop himself and finds that his skills are still sharp.</p><p>With the painting hanging in his apartment, suddenly there's joy in his life. “One beautiful piece,” he says, “makes everything different.” A relationship blooms with a woman he's met, and he admits to her what he's done. She seems to accept the one theft—and, he insists, it's just this one theft—but when the romance ends, she informs the police, and Breitwieser is put in prison again.</p><p>By the time he gets out, he's 41 years old, creases at his eyes and a hairline in retreat. He has an idea that he'll launch a career as a museum-security consultant, but he's the only one who doesn't find this a joke. To hell with everyone, he thinks. “I can live on an island like Robinson Crusoe and it wouldn't bother me,” he says. He eats lunch most days with his mother and then wanders alone in the woods.</p><p>The problem is that he knows exactly what he wants. Just one more sensual blast like the thump he felt every time he unlocked the door to his lair. But when he closes his eyes and tries to conjure the scene, all he can see is a fire.</p><p>Then one day in early 2018, he comes across a brochure for the Reubens House Museum. And there it is, like a slap in the face—a photo of the Adam and Eve ivory, the first thing he'd once regarded every morning. It had been thrown in the canal, but ivory is sturdy and it hadn't been damaged. Now the piece is evidently back on display.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Just looking at the photo pries open some box inside him that he'd hoped had been forever sealed. He's not sure if he ever wants to see the ivory again or if he has to run immediately to the museum. For more than a month, he fights an internal battle before deciding that he needs to go.</p><div><span><picture><div class=\"RIL_IMG\" id=\"RIL_IMG_14\">

            </div></picture></span></div><p>He travels to Belgium, enters the Rubens House Museum, and heads to the rear gallery. And there it is, in the same spot, in a reinforced case. Twenty-one years have elapsed since he'd stolen it, but the ivory's power to enchant is unlimited. Breitwieser leans forward, knees bent, so that his face is directly in front of the carving. His eyes widen, his forehead scrunches—the look on his face a jumble of awe and distress. An electric intensity seems to build in him until it appears as if he's ready to combust.</p><div></div><p>He doesn't want to make a scene in the gallery, so he hurries out to the museum's courtyard. The air is warm, spring is coming. He shuffles foot to foot on the pale cobblestones; the wisteria on the walls is just starting to bud. The last time he'd been here, the ivory was under his jacket. This time he stands with nothing at all, tears blurring his eyes, mourning the lost years of his life—not when he was stealing, but since he's stopped.</p><p>He says he only realizes now, in hindsight, what he couldn't possibly have known then: His previous visit to this museum may have marked the high point of his entire life. The absolute pinnacle.</p><p>He aches for what he once was—“a master of the world,” as he puts it—and he weeps for what will never be again. The paintings especially. But also the sheer thrill of it. “Art has punished me,” he says.</p><p>Then he heads to the exit, through the gift shop, where the museum catalog is sold, with a photo of the ivory and a story of its theft. He has no cash—just to get here, he'd borrowed gas money from his mother—and out of habit he notes the positions of the cashier, the security guard, the customers. He checks to see if there are any security cameras. There aren't. He picks up a copy of the catalog and walks discreetly out the door.</p><hr><p><em>Just recently, in early February of 2019, Breitwieser was arrested yet again. French police had reportedly been suspicious for several years that Breitwieser had resumed stealing and searched his residence in northern France. There, French authorities allegedly discovered Roman coins and other objects that police say may have been taken from museums in France and Germany. Breitwieser is currently incarcerated, pending further investigation, and has yet to respond to these newest allegations.</em></p><p><strong>Michael Finkel's</strong> <em>recent book, ‘The Stranger in the Woods,’ was a best-seller—and grew out of his GQ story, “<a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/the-last-true-hermit\">The Strange &amp; Curious Tale of the Last True Hermit</a>.”</em></p><p><em>A version of this story originally appeared in the March 2019 issue with the title \"The Secrets Of The World's Greatest Art Thief.\"</em></p></div></div></div><aside></aside><div aria-live=\"polite\" aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"presentation\"></div><div></div><div></div></div></div><div class=\"RIL_IMG\" id=\"RIL_IMG_15\"></div></div>"
