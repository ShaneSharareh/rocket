</div></div></div></div></div></figure><p>Shopify has finally attracted mainstream attention of late, due to the company’s remarkable (and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/AnthPB/status/1067913106930745345?s=19\">remarkably quiet</a>) success in one of this millennium’s hottest, most competitive markets: ecommerce. That should come as no surprise, because the Shopify platform had strategically occupied a blindspot in Amazon’s territorial map, as discussed in “<a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/\">Shopify and the Power of Platforms</a>”:</p><blockquote><p>Aggregators tend to internalize their network effects and commoditize their suppliers, which is exactly what Amazon has done… Amazon benefits from more 3rd-party merchants being on its platform because it can offer more products to consumers and justify the buildout of that extensive fulfillment network; 3rd-party merchants are [atomized, modularized, commoditized, and thus] mostly reduced to competing on price.</p><p>That, though, suggests there is a platform alternative — that is, a company that succeeds by enabling its suppliers to differentiate and externalizing network effects to create a mutually beneficial ecosystem. That alternative is Shopify.</p><p>At first glance, Shopify isn’t an Amazon competitor at all [but the] difference is that Shopify is a platform: instead of interfacing with customers directly, [its] 3rd-party merchants sit on top of Shopify and are responsible for acquiring all of those customers on their own.</p></blockquote><figure><div><div><div><div><div></div><div class=\"RIL_IMG\" id=\"RIL_IMG_4\">

</div></div></div></div></div></figure><p>In other words, Amazon built a behemoth by aggregating commoditized suppliers under the Amazon banner, and that grand centralization naturally provided a market opportunity for a complement — a mirror opposite — which Shopify launched with its platform for differentiated suppliers, who operate under their own banners, using the ecommerce infrastructure of an otherwise faceless Shopify. That essentially describes the “<strong>Janus Rule</strong>”…</p><blockquote><div><p><strong>The Janus Rule</strong>: Markets like these tend to accommodate two complementary businesses that are mirror reflections of one another — one being an aggregator of commoditized suppliers and the other a platform for differentiated suppliers.</p></div></blockquote><p>In other words, two’s company; three’s a crowd. As such, juxtaposed against those two faces of ecommerce — who are nestled neatly in their respective moats — Walmart has largely failed in its multi-decade assault on Amazon. The retail giant originally came-up short due in large part to the classic <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma\">Innovator’s Dilemma</a>, as discussed earlier in the piece excerpted above:</p><blockquote><p>[A]fter years of trying to leverage its stores in e-commerce, Walmart realized that Amazon was winning because e-commerce required a fundamentally different value chain than retail stores… the proper response to that recognition was not to try to imitate Amazon, but rather to focus on areas where the stores actually were an advantage, like groceries, but it’s worth understanding exactly why attacking Amazon head-on was a losing proposition…</p><p>[While Walmart was taking 19 years to mount its assault], Amazon.com effectively bifurcated itself into a retail unit and a fulfillment unit: The old value chain is still there — nearly half of the products on Amazon.com are still bought by Amazon at wholesale and sold to customers — but 3rd parties can sell directly to consumers as well, bypassing Amazon’s retail arm and leveraging only Amazon’s fulfillment arm…</p><p>Walmart and its 20 distribution centers don’t stand a chance [against Amazon’s 300], particularly since catching up means competing for consumers not only with Amazon but with all of those 3rd-party merchants filling up all of those fulfillment centers.</p></blockquote><p>Once Amazon had reached scale, the cat-was-out-of-the-bag. At that point, we know an outsider cannot play offense or defense against an incumbent on the incumbent’s home turf. You cannot attack them half-heartedly or head-on like Walmart did Amazon. From “<a href=\"https://medium.com/adventures-in-consumer-technology/the-carrot-and-the-stick-on-the-missing-incentives-for-crypto-networks-87af5eed5deb?source=post_page---------------------------\" rel=\"noopener\">The Carrot and the Stick</a>”:</p><blockquote><p>New entrants can only sustain were they to aim for “new market disruption” in which they occupy incumbents’ blindspots — completely new vectors where incumbents can’t squash upstarts for fear of cannibalizing their own, preexisting cash cows. Think in terms of Google disrupting Microsoft by organizing the chaotic web — as opposed to Firefox just building a better browser than Internet Explorer. Don’t build a better mouse-trap; build a waterwheel the mouse can spin to produce hydroelectricity.</p></blockquote><p>In contrast to Walmart’s greatest failure, the occupation of Amazon’s blindspot was perhaps Shopify’s greatest success, which actually serves to ratify parts of <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation\">Disruption Theory</a>.</p><p>At the same time, the divergent fortunes of Shopify and its half-sister, Etsy, provide an interesting empirical case study that ultimately exposes weaknesses in today’s generally-accepted Aggregation Theory. Furthermore, this Shopify/Etsy bifurcation demands specific refinements to the emergent Moat Map doctrine…</p></div>
